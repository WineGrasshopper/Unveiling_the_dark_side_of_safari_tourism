# Unveiling the Dark Side of Safari Tourism: Negative Guide Behaviors from Tourists' Perspective

## Abstract
This research applies a convergent mixed method, integrating qualitative content analysis with big data analysis, to examine 91,032 reviews and 3,607 tour programs from Safaribookings. The study develops a theoretical framework categorizing negative guide behaviors in safari tourism into four main themes:

1. Professionalism and competence deficiencies
2. Customer service and management failures
3. Unethical and financial misconduct
4. Safety and regulatory violations

## Methodology
- Data Source: Safaribookings website
- Sample: 91,032 reviews, 3,607 tour programs
- Analysis: Convergent mixed method (qualitative content analysis + big data analysis)
