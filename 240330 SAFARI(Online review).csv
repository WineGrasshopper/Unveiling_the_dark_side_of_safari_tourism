A moyes,UK,Visited: February 2018,25-Feb-18,20-35,first safari,African Comfort Zone (ACZ safaris) LTD,1,Terrible. Book elsewhere. More focused on making money than customer experience,"More focused on making money than customer experience. Booked a safari tour with acz tours in Nairobi. Joshua and the office staff replied very promptly and payment went through smooth. All questions answered fully and quickly, great customer service. The tour itself is described as a 4 day safari. On day one I was picked up 0700 and drove around the city until 0900 picking up guests. The entire day was spent driving to the park with a 1.5 hour visit to park. (Wasted day).

Day 2 was a full 12 hours in the park where we seen lots. Unfortunately the breakfast had ran out of most foods by 0600 and no more was made so felt very hungry.  When lunch came around it wasn't much better, a terrible sandwich with hardly any meat and some rotten fruit.  Day 3 again spent driving, this time from 0700 until 1730. Wasted day again. We got to hotel just as was getting late. Was promised WiFi to which never worked.

Day 4 we spent 1.5 hours in the lake and the rest of the day driving to Nairobi. Again another long day in the van wasted.

Besides all of the following, I would like to point out a few issues. 
1. the drivers where late to pick us up every single morning from their designated meeting time.
2. They were forever driving whilst on their phones and 2 guests had to leave the tour early as they didn't feel safe. We almost crashed in the park trying to get to a rhino and inturn the van not only lost a wing mirror and the back bumper, but got stuck and we all had to get out and push! In a park full of lions haha.
3. The van is restricted to 80km so for 4 hours I had to sit listening to a continous beep noise.
4. Due to being a ride share I was forced to sit in the front as there was no seats in the back of the van. Due to this, I couldn't see very much whilst in the parks. 
5. The van seat was infested with insects. I told the driver to which he shrugged and said ""they won't bite"". As there was no other seat I was forced to sit for 6 hours with insects crawling all over me and my belongings. 
6. The best one of all, the van broke down 3 times and we spent over 2 hours waiting around.  On 2 occasions mechanics tried to help but the bus driver Richard was too pig headed he wouldn't allow and the mechanic left. In turn we lost out of hours in the park because of the poor van maintenance .
7. Out of 7 guests on the trip, 4 left really annoyed and the other 3 were not too happy. One quit his tour 2 days early because of the electrical fire in the van and didn't feel safe. One didn't feel safe driving at night with the driver. And the others had to change their plans to accommodate us so were not happy at all.

Over all the tour was not worth the money paid. Although the park was nice and the animals seen was fantastic, I feel this tour was extremely unorganized and if I had children I'd be furious the drivers put us into such unsafe conditions.  If you have the money I would book else where."
Abby,US,Visited: February 2020,03-Mar-20,20-35,first safari,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,2,Stolen Money,"Though the actual experience of the safari was great, the company stole our money. They led us to believe that due to a switch in lodges (due to a flood), the money that we paid several months in advanced had not been able to transfer from one lodge to the next. They then told us that they we would have to pay for the fees again and they would refund us. Our driver's name was Dennis. He gave us the name and number of his ""boss"", Noah who was suppose to drop of the money in USD at the hotel we were staying at. Of course he never showed up and promised that he would transfer the money into our accounts when we arrived in the us. Of course, he lied again. Till this day, we have no received our refund. This company will steal your money. Do not book with them. The driver smiled in our face the entire time and then ripped us off and refused to drive us into Nairobi unless we paid the fees. BE AWARE. My friends and I are posting this review on every website we possibly can to warn others."
accra,GH,Visited: December 2018,25-Feb-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Impala Tours,1,The sentences on web site are not true,"I never recomend this tour company.  Almost things that they said is not true.
As for the  accomodation, the staff told me that we could  see sunset and sunrise there when  we asked before booking but actually we cannot tehre. We have to move another place to see and it takes one hour one way if we want. The driver said he doesn't want to. As a result, we could not.

As for payment, they said we can pay credit card  but actually they asked me to tell all information about our credit card.
Of course, we could not  for our finance security. And they needed money in advance and they told me to return bank transaction fee later if we pay by bank transfer in advance. So I believed and payed in advance by bank transfer  but he never return.


This is a very shocked trip...."
Achen,CA,Visited: September 2023,01-Nov-23,50-65,2-5 safaris,Kiboko Tours And Travel,1,Very disappointed with our tour guide," This was our family's first time to an African country and we were so looking forward to our safari with Kiboko Tours and Travels. Sadly, we were very disappointed. Due to budget constraints, we did choose the budget option for our safari and for that reason we were not disappointed with the vehicle or the lodges.  Both seemed like they had seen better days, but when you go budget, we know you don't get top of the line transportation or accommodation. However, what we were really disappointed with was our guide. I don't like to be critical of other people and know that it can be difficult being a tour guide, but during and after our safari, we wondered why our guide had chosen to be a tour guide and why you, as a safari company, had hired him for the position. He didn't seem to want to be a safari guide, as he spent more time on his phone (especially on the first day) than sharing with us his knowledge about the parks we¢®?re in, animals we¢®?re seeing and general information about what to expect on each tour. We learned more from the signs at the park and our own background research than we did from our guide. Our guide did not engage with us, ask us about ourselves and what we¢®?d like to get out of our first experience here in your beautiful country. I would think it good practice for tour guides to let their guests to know what to expect each day, and ask them what they¢®?d like to see (keeping in mind, of course, that nothing is guaranteed with a safari). I would expect a tour guide to think of themselves as an ambassador for their country, wanting to share with their guests their enthusiasm and knowledge about their country and what they are able to show their guests. Our guide was not like this at all. In fact, when we asked him questions about the parks we were visiting and wildlife we were seeing he often misinformed us as we found out later through our own online research. I would ask that Kiboko Tours and Travel either provide their guides with training or only hire guides that have been trained and qualified as tour guides. For this reason, I would not recommend this company for your safari. "
Adam,CA,Visited: September 2023,05-Oct-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Super Eagles Travel and Tours,1,Extremely unorganized and I felt they didn¢®?t provide me with the services I purchased,"I booked a 10 day Kenya and Tanzania safari. I am well travelled and this is far from my first tour. Overall I found the company extremely disorganized, my first driver uninterested and rude to other guests, and that I didn¢®?t receive the services agreed on without actively being extremely vocal to get them and some I still didn¢®?t get at all.

There are three main reasons I leave a one star review for this company.

1) I had a morning Safari booked for Masai Mara, the night before I hear the itinerary is changed and we are no longer going there. They told me this is because the government changed the rules from 24 hour passes to 12 hour passes, I would have hopped that they could have either purchased passes on the next morning as that is what I had purchased or made it up in some other way. They seemed completely uninterested in doing either. I was in a group with many others on many different tours, none of theirs had this option, I felt like because mine was the only one with this option they decided to not do anything about this. 

2) After a short morning safari at Nakuru we headed to Amboseli, however on the way we had to stop at a gas station and wait for over two hours to get an additional two members in our vehicle, this meant we got in very late that night. We later found out the 2 members we were waiting for had just started there drive late that day due to the driver. I would have hoped the company would have either let us stay in Nakuru longer or would have sent the two others in a separate car.

3) When we went for our game drive in Amboseli our driver didn¢®?t have the correct payment options causing us to be delayed. He then asked if one of us could pay and he would pay back, he said it was $4 but turned out it was far more. The fact that this delayed us and the fact that he tried to get us to pay more than he said was very concerning. If my AMEX when through (they didn¢®?t take AMEX) I would have been charged a lot more than I was told. 

4) When I crossed the border to Tanzania I was left alone and told a bus would be there at 10:30 to pick me up, already an hour wait after I got through the border. The bus however didn¢®?t come until around 12:30 and didn¢®?t leave until 1:30. It is lucky I had data to communicate with them otherwise I would have been in trouble. The fact that they would never proactively communicate with me or give me accurate times was extremely frustrating.

5) Communication: this was an issue throughout the trip, you would often not know ahead of time what was happening or when to wake up, several nights I would message them throughout the day asking the plan for the next day and they would say ¢®¡Æsomeone will come tell you¢®¡¾ but no one ever would even after asking multiple times, then I would have to wake up in the middle of the night and message some more before finding out what time I had to wake up.

6) One day our whole party arrived at the hotel and the front desk told us there were no reservations for us. I never got an answer from the company as to what happened but clearly it didn¢®?t get booked. We then had to spend a bunch of time trying to figure out where we would all stay for the night as there were not enough rooms. Through pure generosity of the other people I was on tour with they decided to all cram into one room so I could have a room as the hotel only had two left. If not we would have been in a very bad situation late at night with a company that had proven they would make you wait a long time and would not communicate well.

That all being said Juma, my driver for the Tanzania portion was phenomenal. I just can¢®?t justify giving anything but one star based on the other factors. 

Overall this was an extremely frustrating experience and I would recommend staying away from this company. Hopefully I can save someone the pain. "
Adele,US,Visited: September 2015,16-Oct-15,20-35,first safari,Gecko Adventure Tanzania,2,We had to get the bus back,"First I would like to point out that out driver was Brilliant the whole way through. He could not do more to help us (his 7 month pregnant wife picked us up from DAS bus station to take us back to our hotel.

Booking was very easy and effective, the booking agent came to our hotel on the morning of pick up to collect the money from us (I think it is expensive, especially with the quality of car we were provided with).

The car was ancient (it never made it back from the trip) we got a flat tyre 2 hours into the journey (fine, it happens) then another few hours in, the car breaks down and take 2+ hours to fix (meaning the journey ended up taking 10 hours to reach the safari).
Lunch on the way to the Safari (not the modern looking stop) was lovely. It was a traditional buffet lunch.

The hotel at the safari was basic but clean and quite close to the Mikumi National park.
The safari was a great experience, our guide was knowledgeable and made the safari"
Adi,US,Visited: September 2023,04-Sep-23,35-50,first safari,Beacon Safaris,2,Unprofessional,"We planned a 5 day safari with Beacon via Robert. What should have been a memorable and enjoyable experience turned out to be full of stress thanks to their mismanagement.  Avoid if you want a company that works with you to make your trip enjoyable!

Beacon/ Robert promised and received payment for a customized 5 day safari. Our driver was Anthony and it was apparent early on that Robert did not discuss the itinerary with Anthony. Anthony would frequently refuse to follow the itinerary saying it was impractical/ unfeasible. When we tried to contact Robert to mediate, he would be unavailable. Ultimately, we were made to skip game drives or pay extra to go on game drives that were already included in the original invoice. We were told to pay extra because Robert wasn't aware of change in park fees.  At the end of the trip, we were dropped off not at our hotel but in the middle of Nairobi. Again thanks to miscommunication between Robert and Anthony. The only reason this isn't a 1 star review is that Robert agreed to split the cost of the additional safari drives even though he had already received payment for it. 

I wish this review was about Kenya's beautiful parks and the game drives we went on with Anthony. But our lasting impression of the trip was uncertainty and stress.  Robert and Anthony at Beacon, while not dishonest,  were disorganized, unprofessional and uncaring about giving you an enjoyable safari experience. "
ADRIAN TORTORA,AR,Visited: July 2019,18-Jul-19,50-65,first safari,All Seasons Safaris and Tours,2,"Very bad vehicles, old and poorly maintained and terrible guide.","The attention of Alex and Denis is excellent and they try to fulfill everything promised.
The problem is the vehicles used for the zafari, old, poorly maintained, they break halfway and lost hours on the route with mechanics, as if it were not enough to finish the arrangement I had to pay for the repair with later refund of money . Even there are mornings in which you have to push the vehicle because it has exhausted the battery. This means that the itinerary can not be fulfilled, and late arrivals to destinations are reached.
But even worse is the guide in Kenya (Paul) is lousy, has a bad predisposition to explain, is rude, does not even have a bottle of water to facilitate, which was committed in the contract. And of course he does not have binoculars like the rest of the guides.
The place is wonderful, but my advice is to hire another company to be able to enjoy without suffering these inconveniences."
Adriana,DE,Visited: January 2020,15-Apr-20,20-35,2-5 safaris,Twinkle Star Tours and Safaris,2,A huge disappointment.,"I will start with the fact that the 2 stars in this review are given to the beautiful Kenyan and Tanzanian nature and our amazing tour guides Brian from '7 Wonders' and Timothy-Simon from 'Twinkle Star' who made up for a large portion of their superiors' countless failures. Poor guides were at the same time also drivers and on top of it had to deal with numerous misunderstandings and failures due to the badly organized schedules and itineraries courtesy of their supervisors.
People like Brian and Simon should be the ones running the companies and not the other way around.
I was a part of a small group that took part in a 15-day Kenya-Tanzania tour, organized by Twinkle Star Tours and Safaris.  
Despite of me being an equal part of the group, paying the same price for the tour and ultimately sharing the same disappointment, I would not have written this review and kept my disappointment to myself had I not seen the reply from Benson of Twinkle Star Tours to my husband's review. 
Benson's reply just confirms what was said in the previous review about this tour operator's behavior- a total refusal to assume responsibility for anything and twisting of simple facts.
My husband explicitly asked the owner of Twinkle Star- James if the original itinerary will still be preserved despite of the 11 day delay in payment due to PayPal refusing to mediate such a large payment to a private account in Kenya. However, we managed to take care of the situation and once James Oketch confirmed in writing that the original itinerary will be unaffected and preserved we initiated the payment.
We were only briefed about the changes in accommodation *after* we had arrived in Kenya. This was of course very well planned on Twinkle Star's behalf since we were left with very little choice in the given circumstances. What were we to do? Say 'No, thank you.' and pack our bags, buy new airplane tickets for 3 times the early booking price and fly back to Germany?
They knew exactly what they were doing when they only informed us about the changes once we were already in Kenya. A decent company would ask their clients prior to their departure if they would agree to itinerary changes for a lower standard accommodation and if not they would refund them. Unfortunately 'Twinkle Star Tours' is not such a company. Despite of it all my husband still protested on a number of occasions about the changed itineraries and the bad conditions in some of the places we stayed in, about the missed or messed up lunch boxes and etc. The tour guides knew it all and they communicated it to James Oketch and Benson and their Tanzanian counterparts and on some occasions my husband did that too.
Spending our nights in tented camps in the middle of the Savannah would've been perfectly fine for the younger people in our group but we also had an elderly person with us who has several non- negligible health conditions. 
Having to shower with cold water due to yet more technical problems, being provided with scarce nutrition choices and being unable to go out of your tent at night because of the wild beasts roaming  around was not our elderly companion's idea for a 350USD a night accommodation and it was not what we paid for and agreed on.

As for the so-called safari vehicle. On the official website of 'Twinkle Star Tours and Safaris' it states 'We have invested in top of the range and reliable landcruisers for all our Land Safaris'. James personally confirmed in writing to my husband that their safari vehicles are up to the best modern standards but then again they also advertise 'We select top of the range and luxury hotels and lodges for that extra ordinary service' on their website and then you end up having to either shower cold, shower with filthy buckets by mixing hot and cold water by yourself and either bringing you on the verge of starvation or food poisoning you and your tour guide like it happened in Tanzania.
The above-mentioned antiquated minivan was absolutely not to the task of taking us on time to our destinations or let alone offering us a comfortable ride.
It had no air conditioning in the scorching heat. The air filters of the rusty minivan were situated at such a low level that when the slightest amount of water splashed the vehicle it meant we had to either wait for it to dry up or miss a game drive entirely.
We missed a morning game drive in Maasai Mara because it had rained a little the previous night and our guide was afraid water might get into the air filters, we missed a game drive upon arriving to Amboseli because we had to take alternative roads just so we can avoid water getting into the air filters, the next day we had a hurried 2 hour game drive instead of a full day one because our food menu plan was again messed up/not communicated properly to the lodge and we were again starving during the game drive, we missed another morning game drive because water had gotten into the air filters and the minivan was barely operational. We had long waits to just cross muddy/wet areas because of the badly situated air filters of the old minivan while virtually every other tour vehicle around us was passing through with no difficulties whatsoever.
It was a nightmare...

As for the promised small refund that James kept lying about. It was not simply delayed like Benson is putting it in his comment, it simply never happened.
Dear Benson, a delay means a few days, maybe a couple of weeks in extraordinary circumstances but a delay is certainly not 70 days. A 70-day delay means unfulfillment of commitment. 
Every couple of weeks James came up with new excuses and simple lies to delay the promised refund. The latest excuse is the virus crisis and that they are always confined to their homes(not true)and online banking doesn't exist in Kenya(obviously not true as they have that and they have PesaPal)but any slightly intelligent person could easily spot the dishonesty of James and Benson as the refund was promised and arranged for more than 70 days ago when there was no virus crisis in Europe, the US or Africa and when business was going as normal.
Twinkle Star Tours, your behavior is absolutely disgraceful.

In conclusion, I encourage other travelers to visit the breathtaking natural beauty and stunning wildlife variety of East Africa. Just not with 'Twinkle Star Tours' because with them things will only work out if all the right stars align perfectly for you and your group and if something goes wrong along the way, you will be on your own."
Agata,CH,Visited: February 2023,06-Mar-23,20-35,first safari,Safari Update Travels,2,"Overpriced dishonesty, don't go with them!","Unfortunately, can't recommend this company. Their offer and price doesn't reflect the actual services and the moment you have a complaint they stop responding. We booked a group mid-range safari but everyone else in the group booked a budget one, so we paid double (or triple?) and got the same service but accommodation. The jeep was far from luxury and they promised a goup of 6 ppl but ended up cramming 8 people in the small jeep most of the time. We also paid for 2 entries to Masai Mara but were taken once, while everyone else in our group went on the extra game drive and we were not told about this (!!!). The only positives were the accommodation and the driver - he was great and we managed to see plenty of animals."
Agnieszka,BE,Visited: August 2021,08-Sep-21,20-35,2-5 safaris,Sandland Tours and Safaris,1,The agency is FRAUD!,"Me and my friend, we ended up with the Abraham Shaidi¢®?s company (Sandland) as a third part booking. We booked a 5 days safari trip with the Three Peaks Safari agency which sub-contracted our trip to Abraham¢®?s company without asking us.

Our experience was terrible. We have never seen the migration in the North part of the Serengeti neither the Ngorongoro crater as it was in our plan.
Our guide, Albert Lema drove like crazy, broke the safari rules several times by disturbing animals¢®? peace and put us in danger. We did not feel safe in the car and in the campsites (e.g. driving 90km/h, texting us in the middle of night when we slept, putting us between lion cubs and making noises etc).

On the 3rd/ 4th day, Albert and his boss became very rude to us, blaming us that we cost a lot. Albert also yelled at me in the front of clients, he left the camp at 8pm with our suitcases and without debriefing us. Next day at 08:30am, he came back to the camp without saying any word. He gave us his phone and asked us to speak with his ¢®¡Ædirector¢®¡¾. Albert and Abraham asked us for EXTRA MONEY in order to go to the Ngorongoro crater or we would come back to Arusha. I called the Three Peaks Safari agency and explained the situation. The agency called the police¢®?.at the end, we have never seen the crater...

Moreover, the chef, Hilda pretended to be a 26 years old single Maasai mother from Arusha (while she was from the village Mto Wa Mbu as well as Albert) was also a very rude, aggressive and laud person.

The owner is crook and the safari guide with a chef ? liars! PLEASE AVOID IT"
Ahmad,CA,Visited: July 2017,22-Aug-17,20-35,first safari,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,1,Look For Somewhere Else !!!!!!!!!,"When my flight arrived at 10:30am driver wasn't there I waited 2 hours for him to arrive. And the driver wasn't my actual tour guide he is a tour guide for another group. His excuse for arriving late that his car was damaged, but in the end I found out he was lying and my actual tour guide made a deal with this other tour guide (Who will pick another group that I don't know) to go to the airport to pick me up because I was solo. And because of that he arrived late cause the other group's flight arrival is at 1:00pm. My trip plan is private tour which means driver must to pick me up alone without other group!!!!!!!!!!! And to top all that the car was in super bad condition. To sum up this company is a so unorganized, very old vehicles, don't care about customer satisfaction, and do whatever they want to do without even asking beforehand if I agree or not. Please avoid so that you will not end up with similar experience or even worse."
Ahmet,US,Visited: June 2015,31-Jul-15,20-35,first safari,Migada Adventures Ltd,1,Just Awful,"We booked a 7-day Kenya+Tanzania safari with a Kenyan operator and the 3-day Serengeti-Ngorongro portion was subcontracted to Migada. Unlike the Kenya portion, Tanzania was terrible in every way and our vacation was half-ruined. 

The car had multiple problems and was absolutely unsafe. Breaks were bad and locked the tires on gravel roads so downshifting was the way to slow down. Parking break didn't work so it was always exciting to see the car run away until driver used rocks to stop it. Engine didn't start if turned off when it's warm, so engine ran the whole day even when parked next to the animals. We had to ask other drivers for a bump when driver stalled the engine. The car didn't have radio so game viewing was random. A policeman warned us about the wheels being not fit to drive. But more on the car later. 

The driver got lost multiple times, starting day 1 from Isebania to the lodge in Serengeti. When it was getting dark he panicked and started driving movie stunt style on horrible roads, doing a pretty high jump where tires detached from the ground for about 4 seconds that felt like hours. No empathy with passengers' comfort for restroom or lunch breaks, we had lunch inside the car in dust while driving. The company's card was out of money while exiting Serengeti so we had to wait about an hr just to exit a park. Nothing happened smoothly..

The car broke down a few minutes after our descent into Ngorongro, and we found out the radiator had a leak that the driver knew about. His calls to the office were unanswered but another safari driver was kind enough to stop and take us into his car, and tow the broken car until the nearest water hole. We helped fill the radiator with muddy water and plugged the hole with elephant dung and the car surprisingly made it to Arusha the next morning on mud, dung and prayers. They gave us a new car from Arusha to Kenya border and then came our best moment in Tanzania: getting exit stamps and seeing our Kenyan driver on the other side. 

Thinking back about the whole thing, we should've rejected getting into that car after the first day."
Ahron,KE,Visited: December 2016,11-Jan-17,20-35,first safari,Wanyama African Safari,1,Shabani's scam,"We booked 4 days safari with Shabani's company. It was a disaster!!
1. The cars were completely full. 9 people including the chef instead of 7 as promised. When we asked Abdul (our guide) to solve this issue he gave us  unacceptable solutions (leave the chefs and that we will cock for our self). Also the cars were fulled with equipment so there was no place for the legs.
2. Abdul the guide was unprofessional. After we talked to him about some of the problems he decided not to talk to us and didn't explain anything during the game drives, even not the names of the animals. He was just a taxi driver that took us from one location to another.
3. Time in the Safari weren't as promised. In the first day of the Sarangeti we had only two hours of game drive. 
4. A lot of small annoying issuesthere were not enough tents in the first night for everyone, in the second day the chefs refused to wake up early in the morning to make us breakfast because it was too ""early"" for them.  

When we came to Abdul ,asking for solutions for our problems he didn't show any intention to figure out them out and he even blamed us one time that the reason we got late to the Sarangeti (16:30) is because we asked him to stop to photograph giraffes on the way.

When we got back to Arusha we went to Shabanis office to talk with him about everything. During the talk he blamed us for being ""hard customers"" and didn't even say he was sorry about anything. Eventually he started to talk in aggressivly when we said we will write a bad recommendations.  When we got out from his office (without any compensation) he even tried to hit one of the girls and we had to stop him. When we walked out to the street he keep followed us, this was really scary and unpleasant.

I think Sahabani is a dangerous man and even that his prices is low it doesn't worth the bad feeling."
Ailsa,US,Visited: June 2016,01-Aug-16,20-35,over 5 safaris,Seven Wonders Safaris,1,Do not book with this company,"Do not book a tour with Seven Wonders in Arusha. In all of my travels, it was the worst experience I¢®?ve ever had. This is not just a post about a bad tour company, this is a safety warning to all travellers ? please do not use this company. 

My boyfriend and I booked a safari to the Serengeti and the Ngorongoro Crater for 3 days and 2 nights. Our cook was great, but our guide was awful. We shared the safari truck with two lovely French ladies, and we were all told that the guide spoke both French and English ? but he didn¢®?t speak either (other than a few basic phrases), which made communication very difficult. 

He couldn¢®?t tell time, and kept telling us to get up for breakfast at 2:00 am (which we actually did the first morning!). He was very disorganized and always late, which decreased the amount of time we got to spend each day in the national parks. We had to set-up and take down his tent each morning to try and speed up our departure time, as he didn¢®?t know how to. He didn¢®?t spot one single animal our entire trip! And when we spotted them he would drive past more than half of them. And on our second day when I spotted a leopard, and we requested to park for a better view, he kept driving and said that we had to go home for lunch, yet proceeded to stop for antelope!!! We¢®?re not usually picky with driving, but he was honestly very unsafe and came close to hitting walls, trees and animals on the road on multiple occasions. He was always on his phone in the truck, and when he wasn¢®?t talking on it he was taking creepy pictures of the young French girl (trying to disguise them as selfies). He made the experience so bad that it brought the French ladies in our truck to tears - they called Seven Wonders several times to complain and to try and get a replacement guide, but the manager of Seven Wonders yelled at them over the phone and called them ¢®¡Æliars¢®¡¾ and refused to compensate them in any way. 

As if this wasn¢®?t bad enough, on our last day we were scheduled to visit the Ngorongoro Crater. Our guide had forgotten to pay our tickets for entry the night before, so we were late entering and late leaving the park. Our guide on exiting the inner gate of the crater told us that we had to pay a $70 USD fee per person for exceeding our permit time. We explained to the ranger that it was our guide¢®?s fault because we arrived late, and the guide lied and said that we had threatened to fight him in the truck (3 small girls and 1 guy vs. 2 grown men!), and that we had made him stay late. When we tried to exit the last gate of the park in a taxi, we were detained because the fee had not been paid. The head park ranger agreed that Seven Wonders should pay the fee, and he arranged over the phone with the manager the he should mobile transfer the money. He never did, and as a result we were kept at the gate until after dark before being allowed to finally leave at 8:30 pm (after waiting for 5 ¡§? hours).  

The next day, we were approached at our hotel in Arusha by the manager of Seven Wonders, along with a group of 5 other men. He told us we needed to pay him the $140 USD. We tried to calmly reason with him, but he was simply aggressive and rude, and accused us of lying. They wouldn¢®?t leave, and harassed us until we asked for the police to be called. The police warned us that these men were dangerous, and that they believed that if we didn¢®?t give them what they wanted they were going to hurt us. The police were unable to charge them unless they did first harm us, so we filed a police report and had to be driven to a hotel outside of town where we were safe. 

Please be warned ? these are bad people. Do yourself a favour, there are many other tour companies you can choose from.

AJ,US,Visited: February 2018,07-Apr-18,20-35,first safari,Orongai Africa Safari,1,"Poor management, did not follow itinerary, rude, Great driver","I recommend looking ELSEWHERE before booking with Orongai Africa. I am not one to write bad reviews but my poor experience with them warrants such review. 

I priced out many safaris prior to booking and specifically requested going to Lake Manyara weeks before booking with Orongai. They agreed to this and I paid a deposit down for a 5 day, 4 night safari. One week after paying for half of the trip, they sent an email with what looked like the same itinerary as we agreed upon. What I did not realize however was that they deleted Lake Manyara (despite our initial request and agreement) from the last day without discussing this with me at all. After arriving in Tanzania from Kenya (which I will give them 1 star of credit for because they were very accommodating to picking me and my significant other up from the border which was very helpful), we had to pay for the second half of the trip. We attempted to pay via paypal with a credit card which ""did not go through"", so I sent a second payment through paypal. Essentially, we paid 1.5x what was originally agreed upon. I have now been back for 4 weeks to the USA and despite emailing multiple times, we have yet to receive a refund for the extra half trip we paid for. I hope we get our money back soon.

Not only is their management rude sending snarky emails back and accusing us of not tipping our amazing guide (for which I take a lot of offense to because we tipped him extra for how great his knowledge and sense of humor was), but they are UNTRUSTWORTHY for changing itineraries AFTER money was already paid. 

I highly recommend looking elsewhere before booking with this company. Save yourself the headache of being accused of being a bad person inappropriately.

On a side note, if you do come across a safari guide named Issac. He is really great and gave us a good experience on 4 out of the 5 days of the safari that the company took us on. The 5th day, they stated we had ""used all of our money up"" and could not go on the last day of the safari before the airport. Such a disaster."
Akira,TH,Visited: July 2019,11-Aug-19,20-35,first safari,Smile with us tours in Africa,2,First time safari with unsatisfy opertator,"We choosed smile with us tour for our tour operator in Tanzania. We felt that Jacob was very active on the communication for planning of the tour and accommodation. On the first day he picked us up late 1 hour and said that our guide will be changed without informing us the reason. We knew later that our guide has just been contacted that morning! Since there has been a change in guide and car and also the poor operation of smile with us tour on the reservation and permit to go to each national park, we spent more than 1.30 hour at each gates (i.e. serengeti and ngorongoro). The worst is that we didn't do the game drive as we spent too much time dealing with all these problems which should not exist if the tour operator is professional enough. Our iternerary was ruined. Our guide tried to manage all problems and planned new itenerary. We felt that this tour operator is very unprofessional."
Al,US,Visited: July 2019,16-Aug-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Angose Travel Limited,1,Dishonest Company,"I'm going to keep it brief, but in general,  Ibrahim is dishonest with his customers and unfair to his staff.  People considering booking with him should understand the risk of booking the cheapest option.  

Three major issues:

1-  When we were leaving Serengeti to go to Ngorogoro, we were told at the gate that Angose had not paid our park fees.  Ibrahim's solution (by telephone) was for one of us to put the fees (about $700) on our personal credit card and then be reimbursed in cash when we got back.  No one was interested in doing this because we felt it seemed like a scam.  There's an online portal for safari operators to pay these fees online if they're not able to do it the usual way (pay in cash at the local bank) so it shouldn't have been an issue.  We waited at the gate for several hours for Ibrahim to come up with a better solution.  Eventually we went to park rangers ourselves and explained the situation and they told us that all we had to do was fill out a form and we everything would be fine as long as they paid the following day before we left the park.  If the solution was that simple, and this has happened before (it's noted in another review on TA), then why did we have to lose an entire afternoon game drive because of it?

After my safari, I met another backpacker who used this company and the same thing happened to them.  

2-  Unbeknownst to anyone, I was booked for a 5 day safari and everyone else was booked for a 6 day safari.   No one told us this and we didn't figure it out until the fourth night.  On the fifth night, Ibrahim called me and told me, ""Ok, your safari is over.  You can either pay $150 more and do the last day with the group or take the public bus back to Arusha (2 hours at night)."" I told him there was no way I was going to do either of those things.  We hadn't gone to Manyara yet which was on my itinerary, I had spent all the money I had budgeted for this portion of my trip, and the bus is not especially safe for tourists (especially at night).  He yelled at me and threatened me over the phone.  It wasn't until I mentioned the police that he backed down.

3-  The way they treat the staff is much worse than other safari companies I have worked with.  There's no tent or meals for the staff.  They sleep in the car and eat leftovers.  Our guide told us that they're paid almost nothing and rely on tips to make a living.  He also said that they weren't given enough money for the supplies so he had to pay for our bottled water out of his own pocket.

In conclusion, I think there would be more negative reviews but people either want to put the situation behind them or they're embarrassed to admit they've been scammed.

Aldug,DE,Visited: September 2015,27-Sep-15,20-35,2-5 safaris,Crocodile Racers Adventures,1,NEVER CHOOSE CROCODILE RACERS,"Back from a ""3 days/2 nights"" in the Mara, we were wondering if it was normal that:

- when we ask us be ready at 7 am to be picked up by our driver in Nairobi, we leave Nairobi at 10am, after 3 different places waiting for something we don't want to explain to us,

- when we are supposed to be maximum 8 in our van, we spend the 3 days at 9 pax including a 6-month baby crying, the other people paying 360USD pp (70 less than us) for exactly the same prestation + water included in their package, not in ours (they also told us they were very angry because supposed to be 6 Max in the van for this price...)?

- when we are supposed to arrive ""on time for lunch"" at Maasai Mara, have a rest and make our 1st game drive around 4pm, we in fact arrived at 4pm at the camp (after an awful lunch in a self service on the road) and entered Maasai Mara at 5.30pm (30 minutes game drive!)

- when it is question of coming back to Nairobi, then, our guide proved us he can be..."
Aleksandra,RS,Visited: August 2019,28-Sep-19,50-65,over 5 safaris,Ocean African Tours,1,"Totally unreliable, too expensive, hire irresponsible drivers, avoid them or you risk too much","We have travelled a lot all over the world and have never had such a bad experience with a tour operator. We only bother to write this review in order to warn people of this company. First of all, they overcharge. Our mistake was that we wanted to prepare everything before our arrival to Mauritius and we chose Ocean African Tours because it seemed to us they had everything we needed. It turned out that hotels have much better deals than the one we arranged with Ocean African Tours. Mia, their driver picked us up at the airport and in the following days took us on two tours over the island. His knowledge of the history of the island and its sights is miserable. Obviously he made no effort to learn anything although he acts as a guide. The tours and the price were arranged through the owner of the company. However, Mia did not take us to all the places we wanted to visit with different excuses. Although we originally wanted to go on several tours with them we chose not to, as after 2 tours we realized their service was not to our expectations. Two days before our departure we arranged with Mia to pick us up at 6 am on Saturday and take us to the airport. He did not show up. When we phoned the owner he told us he would be there soon, he was on the way, he lied. So at the time we were supposed to be at the airport, we were still unfortunately, in front of our hotel in Mont Choisy, on the other end of the island. Both Mia and the owner live very close to our hotel but nobody came. After 45 minutes of waiting and several phone calls and promises from the owner we stopped some driver in front of our hotel, explained the situation and he phoned his friend, a taxi driver to take us to the airport. Thanks to this man we arrived to the airport and had to rush to the check in, ask the people to let us go first etc. All in all, we almost missed our flight. You can imagine how stressful it was, having in mind that we have to get to Paris and catch the connecting flight and be home so that we could start work on Monday morning. As a result our luggage was delayed by 5 days. Both the owner and Mia promised compensation for the inconvenience but paid us nothing up to date. As both of them are not men of their word we had to write this review."
Alessandro,US,Visited: August 2015,16-Sep-15,20-35,over 5 safaris,Hog Safaris,1,Bait and switch,"We are writing to report on a recent safari we took in Uganda, Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo at the end of August/beginning of September 2015. We are two very fit American males in our late 20s/mid 30s who were looking for an adventurous vacation in Africa. ?We have both travelled to Africa repeatedly and extensively in the past including South Africa, Namibia, Kenya, Tanzania Male 1 has hiked Mount Kilimanjaro, and Male 2 is an architectural design consultant for hospitality projects in Nairobi and Tsavo region of Kenya.

After researching several tour companies including Instinct Safaris, Boda Boda Travel, Africa Geographic, and Destination Jungle, we decided to go with Hog Safaris Ltd, Plot 31 Kanjokya Street P.O. Box 21588 Kampala, Uganda. 

When building our itinerary, we dealt exclusively with the owner, Ben Katumba. During our initial conversations we outlined three activities that we were keen on doing and asked for recommendations to help round out the trip. The activities were gorilla trekking in Uganda, hiking Mount Sabyinyo in Uganda, and Mount Nyiragonga in DR Congo. Ben was able to work with us to customize the trip based on 3 initially proposed itineraries, not all of which included the 3 activities. In mid-June we decided on an itinerary for 8 nights/9 days since it was inclusive of all 3 requested activities. Other activity options were not well explained by Ben and as anyone researching a trip in the region knows, literature is somewhat limited -- so we were forced into being reliant on Ben¢®?s expertise.

On June 24, we transferred the 50% deposit ($3000 USD) to Hog Safaris, which was not confirmed into their account until 10 July. In addition, with the transfer of money and the agreement to pursue a trip with Hog Safaris we did a few things: 
1.	Informed Ben that that we eat a vegetarian/vegan diet high in greens, no bread, but can eat fish; and that Male 1 is lactose intolerant, so no dairy or cheese
2.	Requested a list of hotels so we could review them on TripAdvisor or their websites to make sure they were suitable for us. ?Our initial budget range we gave them for the hotels was between $200-$300 per person, per night, exclusive of full board which is offered as part of the safari package
3.	Information necessary for the trip (i.e. packing, visas, travel time, etc.) 

Over the course of the next month we began to send numerous emails requesting for a more detailed itinerary of what was sent to us on 24 June (see below ¢®¡ÆItinerary¢®¡¾), including exactly what time we would be picked up for all of the activities, the driving distances between locations, and how the meals would be covered for the entire trip. We only received emails when there was a question / request for money with the excuse of being without internet for a week plus. 

By early to mid-August we still had not heard any confirmation of our requests nor any responses to our questions. One week before, we attempted for two days to call Hog Safaris at the 2 main line phone numbers and 3 mobile numbers listed on their website. ?The numbers were either out of service, missing a digit, or wrong numbers and we could not get in touch with them via phone. 

Less than a week before arrival, we finally received a response as to what the hotels were, some were still missing, and an email that advised us to bring cold weather hiking gear, sleeping bags, hats, gloves, etc ? which we immediately ordered online and had shipped overnight as we were leaving in just a few days. ?Very inconsiderate, especially because we could have been traveling in Europe beforehand and would not have been able to so easily order camping gear on amazon.com.

At this time, I asked for two hotels on the itinerary to change that did not receive good marks on TripAdvisor and inquired about how we get from Entebbe airport to Kampala to begin the trip. Ben responded that the hotel in Kampala was taken care of and said he would change the hotels. 

When we arrived we were picked up in Entebbe, Uganda airport and driven about 45 minutes to Kampala to our hotel. The hotel was very basic accommodations, not something we would have chosen ourselves after traveling on 2 long haul flights for almost 22 hours. Breakfast was included, but was white toast and overripe bananas. 

We met Ben and our guide in the morning, at which point we were told that we had to pay for the hotel and the cab ride from the airport on the spot. This was not communicated to us when he said it was taken care of. I would have certainly booked a cleaner, more comfortable accommodation had I been given the information, as there was a Marriot up the street.

In addition, during this initial meeting, we had to settle a small balance on the cost of the trip ($242 payable in USD) which we knew about and had come prepared with USD as instructed. However, upon giving 3 $100 notes Ben informed us that he would only accept bills printed after 2006 and did not have change. Again, a piece of information that would have been helpful to know prior to arrival. 

Over the course of the trip, we ran into numerous instances where information was not communicated, which made for an unpleasant trip. ?A few of the many examples are: 

1.	Drinks for dinner were discussed as having to be paid prior to the trip. The assumption here was that this was alcohol, however water with dinners ($.50-$3USD) had to be paid each time in local currency, which ended up being a real hassle going to the respective ATMs which charge fees.
2.	All but one hotel was made aware ahead of time that we are vegetarians, and that was only because we made the guide call them in advance, causing them to have to scramble to get a meal prepared for us. Most expected us to eat pizza, which is fine for a day, but not 8 in a row. Furthermore, we expressly told them in advance we do not eat bread or cheese, so do not eat pizza at home, so why would we lower our standards and eat this on holiday? Therefore, most dinner ended up consisting of shredded cabbage, shredded carrots, sometimes cucumber and maybe an occasional avocado. This continued throughout the trip, ham and cheese sandwiches for packed lunches while hiking, and insufficient quantities and quality of food that we didn¢®?t eat. ?Dangerous when strenuously hiking 7+ hours with summits exceeding 3000m.
3.	Hotels that I had requested changed were changed to worse accommodations. Cleanliness was abysmal at the hotels and basic amenities were missing (heat, electricity, hot water). 
4.	Itinerary was poorly built with a lot of down time and no direction, options to do, and extremely long hours in an uncomfortable, dirty car, which we later found out our driver was sleeping in. We had to find internet cafes and find options to do in towns nearby to hotels. Often we were told it was not possible due to limits on gas or entry fees, or time.

Less than halfway through our trip after sleeping poorly, having limited activities, and not eating properly we asked to be brought to the airport to end the trip early. The guide and Ben became alarmed and eventually they heard our concerns and agreed to meet in the middle in terms of hotels and food. The next two nights were fine, passable, and just met our expectations in terms of basic comfort and access to food. We were able to get a salad and have a warm shower. ?Basics. When we arrived in DR Congo we were transferred to a new guide, Noel from ?Matumba safaris. The hotel they had booked, Caritas, was completely inadequate and we asked to switch -- the hotel name which we had never been given before arrival. We were told that we would have to pay to switch and pay for the food, even though the day before we discussed the option of 3 hotels and that Ben would accommodate us in any of them if we didn¢®?t care for the first one. ?When we crossed into the DR Congo, the guide had a different story. ?We were told for one of the lodges it was an additional $379 and $400 for him to take us there. ?We switched to the Ihusi Hotel in Goma which was a dump but we had no alternative. ?We were then forced to pay for our dinner (so no full board) and upon check out had to cough up another $74 in USD bills printed after 2006. ?We contested this with the DRC guide and called Tom and Ben and they did nothing. ?Our hike did not start until after 1030am so it was pointless to even stay in the DRC the night before as the border opens at 6am and there would have been plenty of time to stay in Hotel Malahide (the one hotel in Rwanda that was somewhat comfortable and had food we could eat). Mind you we were really at the end of our ropes after a week -- we had both skipped numerous lunches due to no food, and were only eating a small amount of a few vegetables -- ?the food portion was well underpriced. ?Food costs were never more than 50,000 Ugandan shilling for both of our meals ? less than $15 a meal. ?We asked to see menus and had an online converter to verify.

We then go for our overnight on Nyiragonga the next day the cook was again not informed of us being vegetarians and we were stranded without food on the volcano. We were offered ham and cheese sandwiches again and sausages for dinner. ?This was inexcusable.

We also would like to point out that we were the only 2 on the custom safari so any requests should have been honoured as we paid ¢®¡Æmore¢®¡¾ so we did not have to accommodate an entire group and various demands. ?Our driver also ate with us at our table during meals, which is entirely inappropriate even after we asked him to sit somewhere else. ?We did not spend over $6,000 to go on vacation with some stranger.

Overall, what should have been an adventurous, fun, active, comfortable, relaxing vacation in the outdoors it turned into an miserable, uncomfortable, hungry, dirty, zombie-like 9 days that we ¢®¡Æsurvived¢®¡¾. ?There was very poor communication, lack of direction and planning, and an overall uncaring of how guests felt during the entire trip. It was disappointing and a terrible experience. ?

We felt that it was a bait and switch and with ersatz accommodations, planning was one on the fly, and we were extremely overcharged for room and board. ?We have made the following chart below ¢®¡ÆCosts¢®¡¾ to outline what the actual expenses were. ?Industry standard for markup/commission ranges from 10-20%. Even on the high side of that range that makes the total cost about $4200, not $6200 plus the $150 we had to pay the first night for the airport transfer and hotel and the $100 we had to pay for the upcharge hotel in DRC and food.

It is for these reasons that we are demanding a refund of $2250. ?If we do not receive this in 7 days the we will pursue further legal action against Hog Safaris with the Uganda Tourism Board at www.visituganda.com as well as the Ministry of Tourism at tourism.go.ug as well as maintaining this post on TripAdvisor and Cond? Nast Traveler travel sites, as well as several Ugandan travel blogs (Muzungubloguganda.com, gadvertures.com, nina-travels.com, fathomaway.com to name a few).

Alex,UK,Visited: April 2017,09-May-17,20-35,first safari,Trip Advisor Africa Safaris,1,They are Liars!,"A plus:
It was a beautiful safari and we saw many animals. I want to say many thanks to the chef, his food was very tasty.
Minuses:
We went in the low season, so if you are hoping for what they told in the correspondence, do not believe it! They'll take you as they like. They will not follow the description that is said here. And you will have a safari only in the morning or only in the evening, do not expect that you will spend all the time looking at animals. Our car broke down and we drove 6 hours to the campsite at a speed of 10 km and no one came to our rescue.
We arrived when it was dark, nothing is visible and I hurt my leg, it was swollen and there was a hematoma, and they even do not have a usual first aid kit and they refused even to bring a bottle of cold water that I would put on my leg. On the last day of the safari, the people who were with us, ended their safaris, because they started earlier and we just joined them. At 11 o'clock in the afternoon we were taken to a camping place and we did not go anywhere else!
With all this, the director of this company blatantly lied and denied that everything was fine!
When I gave the guide a tip of $ 85 (4 days of safari for two), he also started to say that we should give tip the chef! Dear authorities, warn people that they themselves should distribute tips between employees, because I thought that they themselves share everything equally. That's why we paid even more!
I do not recommend this company to anyone. The most terrible and deceitful attitude!"
Alex,DE,Visited: June 2014,04-Nov-14,35-50,over 5 safaris,A&A Gorilla Tours,2,No go Operator!!,"I got offer from this company by email. On arrival in Kampala they changed the itininerary at once and gave me lower value als before. The guide Erick was lazy, almost driving to fast and not safe, coming late for departure, not want to stand up early in morning. I missing completly the knowlodge about how to make a tour with foreign guests.
May be other guides are better, but please never go with Erick!"
Alex,CH,Visited: July 2018,12-Aug-18,50-65,first safari,Orongai Africa Safari,1,DON'T TRUST THEM,"In January I enquired Orongai AS for a 5 days safari for late July. Since the beginning, I required to book ONLY lodges from the Serena Hotel Chain with an HB meal plan and to buy the flight from Arusha to Zanzibar for which I already had a reservation. The proposed program for the safari was meeting all my expectations and therefore I paid 50% of the total bill to confirm the trip (with 6 months advance).
FIRST SURPRISE: in June, after my request of details about the baloon trip that was listed into the proposed plan, we discovered that this was actually not included in the price I agreed (and already paid) but was an extra, costing ""only"" 510 US$ per person!!! After many e-mails back and forth with Martha, where I also proposed to pay 50/50 their mistake, I finally end up talking with the owner of the company (Mr Asseri) and I accepted, to pay the extra 510 US$. After we arrived in Tanzania, we were transfered to the first hotel where the Orongai rapresentatives showed up with more than 2 hours delay to the agreed breefing.
SECOND SURPRISE: checking out from this hotel, I discoverd that the meal plan was not HB as per the plan accepted by me and I had to pay 25 US$ per person for the dinner.
THIRD SURPRISE: the off-road car for the safari was a 30 years old Toyota Land Cruiser (much older than any other car we meet during the safari) with (probably) a few MILLIONS miles story: fortunately we had no mechanical problems (and this is a real miracle, considering the treatment this veicles receive) but the level of confort of that car was really poor.
FOURTH SURPRISE: we started the tour and we discovered that the plan was shuffled and instead of the agreed Tarangire-Ngorongoro-Serengeti sequence we would follow a Ngorongoro-Serengeti-Tarangire schedule.
FIFTH SURPRISE: despite my cash paiment for the ballon trip, they didn't succeed in boking that experience.
SIXT SURPRISE: when we were in Serengeti, we discovered that our hotel for the next 2 nights would have been a tented camp (and not a lodge as agreed).
SEVENTH SURPRISE: on the last day we discovered that the flight we were booked on was not the 5:10 pm one I originally requested but a earlier one (3:15 pm).

Based on this, would anyone trust them??

PS1: looking at other feedbacks in this site, looks like I'm not the only one having had this kind of disturbing experience with Orongai AS: probably the blame is not to be put on me

PS2: the only good thing of this safari were the guide (Gabriel) and the driver (Francis). They exceeded all our expectations under every aspect: nice and polite, skilled and commited "
Alex,US,Visited: July 2023,28-Jul-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Hyrax Safaris,1,Look Elsewhere,"My husband and I just completed a 6 day safari through Kenya from Nairobi to Mombasa with drives through Maasai Mara, Lake Nakuru, Amboseli and a sanctuary bordering Tsavo West. We advise you stay away. When we booked the tour, our itinerary listed two game drives through Tsavo West, Tsavo was a bucket list park for both of us, so we were really excited to explore this historical place. Unfortunately on the days of Tsavo, our guide gave us the plan and we were only going to be doing game drives through a resort sanctuary, not through the national park. We felt the company completely misled us about the itinerary and what we thought paid for. Once we expressed our frustration, they told us we were now too far from the actual national park entrance to have any game drives there. This was all after being deceived a couple of days prior about the entrance fee and cost of visiting Lake Naivasha and Crescent Island. Hyrax tried to charge my husband and I $150 USD for this short, optional excursion. We told Hyrax they were overcharging and the entrance to the island wasn¢®?t that much - we checked Crescent Island¢®?s official website which openly lists the price, but we were told by Hyrax that they were being honest with the prices. Once we got to the lake, we took matters into our own hands with what the boat ride and entrance fee actually costs and of course - Hyrax was grossly overcharging us along with the boat company. When we brought this to their attention, they feigned ignorance to the prices or knowledge about the island¢®?s website and listed prices. On our way out of Voi to Mombasa, we discovered they overcharged again for the train ride. They told us they charged us $5 per ticket but the tickets only costs 290KSh (About $2). We were ultimately quite disappointed and frustrated but tried our best to enjoy the animals anyways. Tourists anticipate being overcharged but not disrespected so thoroughly with an apparent professional safari. Look elsewhere."
Alex,AU,Visited: October 2019,29-Jan-20,20-35,2-5 safaris,Orongai Africa Safari,1,Bait and Switch Scam - AVOID,"We booked a 12 day Luxury+ tour through Kenya and Tanzania with Orongai. Despite Orongai confirming all the lodges were booked and paid for (included a number of the high end luxury AndBeyond lodges), itinerary we were promised was nothing like what we got. After 4 days of the 12 days, we cancelled the trip in the middle of the Masai Mara due to serious safety concerns and made our own arrangements to get home. We have never received a dollar of refund from Orongai despite multiple attempts.

Some key experiences:
- The vehicle provided was an old and unroadworthy 2WD van completely unfit for driving through national parks. Side door did not open from the inside, so you couldn¢®?t get out without being let out from the outside. Driver was not a qualified safari guide, but a Nairobi taxi/van driver.

- We had our accommodations changed last minute or without notice from high-end luxury lodges to cheap tent accommodation. After this, we called ahead to the lodges booked according to our itinerary, and only 3 of the 9 remaining nights had been booked. Orongai was unable to be contacted and dismissed emails requesting the confirmation of bookings. We were stuck in the Masai Mara without knowing where we would be sleeping the following night.

- On the second day, we were forced to leave the lodge at 6am, missed the planned game drive, and had to sit in the unairconditioned van for 8 hours till we arrived at the next lodge. We had to use a pit in a village for a toilet break, which felt far from safe. When we arrived at the lodge, they had no record of our booking and hadn¢®?t heard of Orongai. After an hour of the driver trying to contact Orongai to find out where we were staying, we then had to spend another 3 hours in the van to drive to a grossly inferior tent camp on the other side of the Masai Mara.

- Attempts to contact Orongai to confirm our lodgings and provide booking vouchers were futile. At this point, we discovered from reviews that others who had booked this trip had been held against their will, demanded more money be paid for fuel concessions, park fees etc, extorted, made to miss international flights and been in serious car accidents. Note: we couldn¢®?t get out of the van from the inside!

- We realised at this stage that not only had we been completely scammed on the promised accommodation, activities included and itinerary in general, but we were not safe remaining on the tour, and informed our driver we would not be continuing. He became distressed and seemed petrified of what might happen to him if he did not deliver us to the Tanzanian border the following day. This only reinforced our fears, and we had another lodge come to pick us up as soon as possible.

We have been unable to get any refund from Orongai, and since the trip, I have experienced a large amount of serious fraudulent/scam activity on my email and personal accounts. This may be unrelated to Orongai, but seems more than coincidental.

I am sure if we continued the trip, this review would likely have far more sinister content. Glad we got out safely, despite out of pocket a very large some of money.

Bottom line: AVOID. Book your dream trip with a reputable travel agent.

Andre promised us that. As a result, Andre gave us another driver / guide. Moreover, Andre changed three ordered camps without prior notice. One of these camps was outside the national park, and we had to pay additional fees for entering the park. We are very disappointed."
Alexey,US,Visited: November 2021,21-Nov-21,35-50,2-5 safaris,Bon Voyage Masala,2,Avoid at all costs,"The one (and only) good part of the safari was the driver Charles. He was incredibly knowledgeable, charismatic, talented wildlife spotter, and a safe driver.

Everything else about the safari was a scam - one lie after another. I was told we'd have 4 nights of lodges, but ended up with 1 night in a lodge and the rest in cheap camps/hotels. I was told the lodges were closed, but I called the lodge and confirmed they were open. I was told we couldn't visit a lake due to the weather forecast, but the forecast was perfect. The other tour members were told that we were skipping the lake because I didn't want to go there (outright lies). The itinerary was changed multiple times before we departed, with many destinations removed. To top it off, the owner told me he would meet me at the end of the tour to refund me, and unsurprisingly he never showed up.

Avoid this tour company at all costs. It's not worth ruining your Kenya experience."
Ali,ES,Visited: August 2020,08-Sep-20,50-65,first safari,3 Wonders Expedition,1,Worst safari company. RUN AWAY!,"We had a terrible experience with 3 Wonders. It was not communication at all, they did what they wanted after they got the money, changing all the schedule. They mixed 4 different safaris in one group, so it was absolutely a mess. They even tried to squeeze  9 people (it was max. 6 people) plus the driver and the cook in one car. As far as we said we were not going into the car and after a long discussion, two person went in another car,  finally we were 9 persons and only 8 seat belts. It was not enough room for luggage, so some luggage was inside the car what it wasn't very comfortable.
The car was very old, more than 500.000 kms and very bad tires without  tread, we were not safe on that car. You can see the pictures. The driver had to deal  with the engine several times because it was failing, the way back from Serengeti took more than 8 hs. because he had to drive maximum 40 km/hr, we were passed for all cars!
I never got the sunrise game drive at Serengeti and they tried to change my accommodation the last night  at a Lodge for a camping, again a long discussion with a very rude and disrespectful driver Kindu.
Everyday we were asked to have breakfast at 6:30 am and never started the game drive before 9:00 am.
Don't trust this company, you are only a way to make cash, they don't care for anything but money."
Alice,AU,Visited: June 2022,21-Jun-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Pride of Africa Adventures,1,Upsetting: 5 different guides and groups during our 10 day safari,"My partner and I did a 10 day safari booked through Pride of Africa Adventures and Safaris in June 2022. It has taken some time to leave our review as we were pressured by the staff at this company not to leave any negative feedback for them. I would like to share my experience, as I would hate for someone else to have a dream safari trip to include as much stress and tears as ours did. My partner and I were so excited to go on our safari, it was a dream for both of us as we are passionate about wildlife. However, once we arrived in Nairobi we realised this trip was not what we expected. We were passed between different companies, and over the 10 days we were with 5 different tour guides and groups of travellers. We were not told that this would happen, we were only expecting two guides one in Kenya and the other in Tanzania. It caused a lot of stress and upset throughout our trip as we were left not knowing where or who we would be meeting next, and we were sad to leave our fellow travellers who we'd met. One of these groups included a tour of two cars with 14 students, when our booking ensured we would be only in a group of 8 people maximum. This part of our trip was in the Serengeti and due to the large group everything was delayed and we did not get to experience the Serengeti as we hoped due to the wasted time trying to organised the students who were not that interested in the safari as they had come to Africa to study micro finance on a gap year. Although some of our guides were great and put a huge amount of effort into their job, others did not put the same effort which was upsetting. The wildlife was incredible and we hope to return to Africa and have a much more positive memory. We will not be booking again with Pride of Africa Adventures and Safaris and would not be able to recommend them

Alice,NL,Visited: October 2011,06-Oct-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,Faustin Tour and Travel,1,Avoid Faustin tours,"We (my boyfriend and I) booked a full 5-day Mikumi /Selous safari package tour with Faustin. We agreed on the price and paid Faustin the whole amount in advance. We never received a bill, although we asked several times for it! After paying, he told us, that he wasn't accompanying us for the trip, leaving us with an odd driver, who couldn¢®?t speak English. Even though we had many negative incidents with the driver, the peak reached on the last day of the trip, when the driver never turned up at the hotel to bring us back to Dar!!! Even the people from the hotel and the local guides were shocked with this behavior. 

Faustin¢®?s organization was not well planned at all. For more information please read my boyfriend¢®?s (Kosta) review below!!! We never heard from Faustin during the whole tour and are a bit shocked with his response. He uses fake facts/information to respond to honest feedback from customers.  Faustin response doesn¢®?t add up. We booked a full package tour from the beginning (pickup Dar + tour + dropoff Dar), not only a driver and a car! 

Our trip was never about the money, we had the money, it was about the service. We flew to Tanzania for safari, of course we had the money!!! We are not his friends to ask for favors. 

Looking at his negative reviews, his response is always the same. Faustin blames the customer by responding that the customer had no money and he -Faustin- tries to help making a tour possible. Which in our case was not true. He never offered help in any way.

We do not want such an incident to happen to anyone else, that¢®?s why we really not recommend Faustin. If it would be possible, we would give him zero stars.

I bet he is going to respond to my review also negative. 

Be very careful booking your safari by him.

Alice T,MT,Visited: August 2018,26-Aug-18,35-50,over 5 safaris,Xaa Safaris,2,Perfect service and management on the steps of booking; nothing to see and to do on place.,"I booked 3-day-2-night mokoro trip, and it was the most expensive and the most disappointing part of my 16-day-travel. To start from good, the manager, Nobantu, was nice and helpful, she replied to my emails fast and for details. Also, the camp was designed in a wise and nice mannerevery tent is spacious and equipped with en-suite portable shower, bio-lavatory, bed, and blanket. The food was good, and the cook did his best to please us. But this is where good points end.

On the first day, we were sailing on a motorboat for about one hour and then on a mokoro, the little canoes, for about three hours. Under the baking sun. But all of that would be fine enough if we could see at least something except a couple of birds... 

Then we came to the camp and spent the afternoon doing nothing. After we had a 'Nature walk' seeing a lot of excrements of different animals and some insects. The local guides could tell 3-4 sentences as maximum about each species, and we were lucky to have a professor of zoology in our group. From him, we received 90% of information about the Delta and its wildlife.

During the night, in the camp (or village, I don't know) that was not far from us they had a kind of party till 3-4 AM and they make such a bad noise, that if I would have been an animal I would run away as far as I could. 

Next day we had a 'safari walk' on another island, where we saw a herd of zebras and a heard of antelopes. It was early in the morning and from 10 AM to 4 PM we were just sitting in the camp. We were not allowed to walk around because of the 'dangerous wildlife'. I walked a bit at my own risk and saw heaps of rubbish and plastic. Probably that was why it is not allowed to walk around because there is simply NO wildlife in this area, I didn't see there even one simple impala. And I don't think that any wildlife will come there if they won't stop night orgies and pollution.

Coming back I found that my bio-toilet is not working. I asked the staff to do something. 

In the evening, we had a mokoro cruise to the lake with the hippos. They were far away to make good photos, but at least we've seen something - I thought. But at that moment people from this camp/village came on their mokoros shouting so loudly that my group mates started to worry about our lives since hippos are not so tolerated to that crazy sounds as people are. 

When I came back to my tent I found my toilet clean, but it was still not working. 

Next day after the breakfast we just went back to Maun, without any morning activity. 

Honestly, I was expected from Okavango Delta much more. Before that safari, I went to Chobe National Park, for the 3-days-2-nights tour, too. But there we had two safaris every day and just a couple of hours to rest, the staff was experienced and did their best to make us see as much as possible, and we've seen a great number of different animals. In comparison with that, this trip was just for wasting time and money. For this amount, I'd better book a flight and I'm sure I would be impressed much more. "

Allison,UA,Visited: September 2017,17-Sep-17,50-65,2-5 safaris,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,1,Very disappointing safari company,"This was a very disappointing safari due to Noah and our guide. Noah added fees once we arrived in Kenya and charged us multiple times for pick up from the airport. He also did not give the guide information about the length of the safari drives we had paid for or the entire last day of our safari. While the guide was friendly, he did not point out many animals and was not able to show us where we were on maps of the Mara or point out any landmarks that are easily found on a google search. He said he had been a guide for 5 years and worked at a lodge in the Mara for over 10 years prior to becoming a guide. He would not take us to the Mara triangle or southen part of the Mara due to mud and the length of the drive but guides for other guests at our lodge were safely driving throughout the Mara. This safari did not live up to expectations Noah had promised. The guide put in very little effort. We paid admission to Enter Thompson Falls at the bottom and walk up a path to the falls. The guide took us to another location which appeared to be free. We have had wonderful safaris with other companies."
Almudena Soriano,UK,Visited: March 2020,07-Mar-20,20-35,first safari,Diani Travel Centre,1,Horrible,"We booked a day trip to Wasini island, to the Kisite Marine Park. They charged us 60$. Since the beginning nothing went as they told us. When we arrive to the harbour, our taxi driver rushed us to get into a boat(if we can call it like that), it doesn't matter which one. Once there they said we will snorkel for 45mins and in the office they told us it could be as much as we want. Then, once that we are in the middle of the sea, our capitain dropped the engine to the sea!! So then that was not longer working. And the storm that we could see started to rain on us very heavily while we were trapped, soaked wet and cold for more than an hour. Communication with staff was very poor and they seemed to struggle to what to do. This was a safety issue, specially when they started to give life jackets randomly to people, and there were not enough to everyone. This is very serious!!! But what is more annoying is that after the staff got a small boat to help us, they wanted us to carry on with the activity as if nothing had happened!!! There were kids and people were scared. I guess they tried to push us so we wouldn't ask for our money back. The worst thing is we managed to go back to thr mainland and to the office to tell what happened and they didn't want to give us the money back. And we have to deal with the boss over the phone, being rude to us. Not acceptable!!! "
Amara/Ouidad,FR,Visited: November 2022,25-Nov-22,20-35,2-5 safaris,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Sad safari,"Karibu Safaris it's a one-time agency.

Unfortunately we were very disappointed with the safari especially from the guide who was more a driver.
No communication with him except answering yes or no questions.
We were not immersed in the safari with the guide.
We were able to see lions by chance but staying juste 2 minutes juste toi take some pictures.
We couldn't enjoy this moment.
We were embarrass?e to Ask each Time toi get Closer to th? animals because he didn't do it naturally.
We chose a private safari 2 days 1 night.
We arrived on the first day at 12:30 at the lodge for lunch and we left only around 3 pm to start the safari.
We would have liked to leave eaelier to enjoy more instead of waiting 2h in the lodge.
The next day we saw very very few animals because we went through the same places as the day before moving away.
We spoke with other travellers who had the opportunit? to see from the 1st day to see a lot animals including lepopard crocodiles a lot of lions etc.. They were surprises that WE didn't see all this on the first day.
In conclusion, we have not discovered the Masa? Mara as it's legend says and the people who describe it this is a huge disappointment because we leave with a taste of unfinished.

Amie,US,Visited: February 2020,02-Feb-20,20-35,first safari,Tin Tin Tours,2,Not recommended for Kilimanjaro,"I booked a Kilimanjaro climb with Tin Tin and was unfortunately was overall unimpressed and would NOT recommend this company for a Kilimanjaro summit. Highlights and lowlights are below.

Pro:
-Supporting a local KPAP company.
-The porters (Rashidi ""happy happy"", Ayubu, Gabriel, Lamiki, Rashidi) and camp manager (Mido) were kind.

Cons:
-Communication. The main POC, Fred, was very responsive at first. However I began getting email auto replies that his email was over quota after I had paid for my trek and it took him a week or so to respond to anything. My guide, Rama, was also hardly fluent in English. He could not understand questions I asked him. 
-Safety. I am not convinced my guide was first aid certified considering he did nothing when I had a fever on the mountain. Health checks were not done twice daily with blood pressure and oximeter readings as originally promised.
-Experience. My guide made me uncomfortable with things like asking me to guess the age of all the other staff members in front of them and bringing the entire group into my tent with no warning when I was sick. He also did not pace well. During the summit hike, we hiked too quickly up the mountain and had to slow down a few hours in. It made for a frigid hike and I was unhappy to miss seeing the summit in daylight.
-Gear quality. My tent was not waterproof and had cigarette burn holes in the bug netting. I rented a waterproof bag from them and it had holes around the straps. I did not notice until my clothing was wet on the trip."
Amrutha,IN,Visited: September 2019,13-Oct-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Pega Tours & Travel,1,Dishonest cheats!,"Try to avoid this safari company at all costs! Reasons below:

1. We were quoted 120 USD for 2 people for a private safari. After reaching, we were put together with 3 more people, who paid 45 USD each, but the price was not reduced for us. Later, after finding out, when we asked for a refund, it was denied by the company.

2. The safari promised was for 12 hours. The guide cum driver (the owner's son) stopped abruptly at 12:30 for a 3 hour break. They probably have a connection with this hotel, and though we all carried our own food, we had to stay in the hotel for this time.

3. The homestay was in the owner's house. The flush does not work properly, the bathroom does not drain, so you are in a pool of dirty water.

4. The owner's wife would knock and enter the room without waiting for a reply.

5. We were forced to leave at the same time as the owner and his sons left for office, since they wanted to economize on one round to drop us at the bus station. 

6. After all of this, and cheating us of 30 USD, the owner was trying hard to sell their Masaai Mara package to us, though we kept telling things were already arranged.

Our trip was amazing, except for this single experience."
Amy,CZ,Visited: June 2017,24-Jul-17,35-50,first safari,Kilisa Tours & Safaris,1,Kilisa Tours and Safaris should be avoided!,"I had a horrible experience with Kilisa Tours and Safaris. Originally I had booked with them because they had received such positive reviews from Trip Advisor. They also offered cheap prices and I decided to go on a safari with them, but I am glad that I didn't book with them to do Kilimanjaro otherwise they would have definitely botched it up. 

Twelve days before my trip, they informed me via email that my hotel was changed from Moshi to Arusha and that the tour group decided to start a day earlier. I had been doing Mt. Meru and Kilimanjaro so I had no email access, and went to the hotel that they booked me in Moshi. I was told that I was booked for Moshi by Kilisa tours, but there was not room for me and I had to go to another hotel. 

After Naick was told, he tried to tell me I should have gotten the email and I explained that I had no Internet access since I came to Africa. I was tired after my 8 day Kilimanjaro trip, and he claimed that the Lemosho route that I had done should have finished at 5AM. That isn't true as I didn't finish until 2PM that day with another group as we went back to the gate, and then had lunch before I was dropped off to my hotel. 

So instead of staying at the Key's Hotel, in Moshi (which I was originally told) and had a high standard, I was booked to stay in Arusha Centre Inn in Arusha which is a much lower caliber hotel. However, I was not told this, and the price that I paid for the safari did not change. 

I was also asked if I brought $875 in cash to pay for the trip. I had not been informed via email to do this, and asked if I could pay by credit card. Instead, I was told that to avoid a surcharge, I would pay for the park admission which would total $875. I was not told that I would be paying for the park admission of the other people on the tour and my tour guide. 

I was not told that the safari was going to be with other people and it was thru another company that wasn't associated with Kilisa. I thought all of these other tourists were from Kilisa tours. I was driven to Lake Manyara to catch the tour group on their second day of the safari since I had missed the first day. 

They were staying at the Sunbright campsite which offered a cabin. I was given a cabin initially, but when two people in my group complained that they had a cabin before, but were then designated to stay in a tent, the manager asked me to move to the tent and to give the two people the cabin. I was sick and had a cough (after finishing my Kilimanjaro trip) and despite that these two people paid less than me, I had to move. 

For the next 2 days I ended up sharing a tent with 2 other people on the trip that I didn't know. 

When I went to pay at one of the park gates, I was told to pay $10 more than Kilisa had informed me. Although that shouldn't be a big deal, I did not like how the driver had forced me to just pay, and not question it. I was angry and said that at the next park gate, I would pay $10 less so that I would not be overcharged. The driver did not like that and insisted that I pay what I was told to pay. 

On the last day, at 9:40AM at Ngorongoro Crater, our safari car had broken down. Our driver called his friend to pick us up and take us back for brunch at 11AM. The friend just drove us back to our campsite and we didn't do anymore sight-seeing. Then when the driver got back with the safari car repaired, we had to be driven back to Arusha and end the trip. 

I asked for a refund as I paid for 4 days for the safari, and on the last day, since the safari car broke down, we could not explore Ngrongoro Crater much at all. I brought this up to Naick who tried to claim that the second safari car had taken us around Ngorongoro but I insisted that it only drove us back to the camp site. Then Naick said that the blame was actually for this man from another company who actually run the trip, and that man refused to refund me saying no one had ever complained about the trip. 

At the end of the day, I wish that I hadn't booked with Kilisa as there were these screw ups with the hotel and also having a cheap safari car that broke down. Also, since the safari car was overloaded with 5-6 passengers (sometimes with the cook too) and luggage, I did not get to see the animals properly nor take as good pictures as I expected to. 

Stay away from this company!"
Amy,AU,Visited: September 2018,11-Nov-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Mushra Travel Agency,1,Tour cancelled half way through; disgraceful communication throughout,"We booked two tours with Mushra: 6 days in Uganda (2 people) and 7 days in Tanzania (3 people) in September / October. Big mistake. 

There were so many issues and disappointments it¢®?s difficult to wrap up into a review. To try and keep it simple, I¢®?ve tried to focus on the key areas. Tanzania was the ultimate disaster where we were left fearing for our safety as a result of Mushra¢®?s actions. 

The individuals within our group have travelled extensively across the globe for 15 years and never encountered anything like the horrible experience we had with Mushra. We do not recommend their services to anyone. 

Communication - things were going well throughout the sales process and all our queries were answered very quickly. However as soon as we paid the money (~USD8000) all communication stopped. To the point where we were unsure if the company really existed and if tours would go ahead. None of our final questions were answered and there was no recognition of final logistical information like pick up locations. 

Uganda - although we were told we had the top female guide in the country we struggled the entire trip from a continued lack of communication from both Mushra and the guide (Safinah). Multiple activities had been promised to us as part of the itinerary we paid for but were not included in the itinerary Safinah had been given to deliver (Batwe/pygmies cultural tour, three game drives). When we asked for these things to be corrected we were made to feel that we were being demanding and difficult - when actually all we were doing was politely asking to get what we paid for. This caused us anxiety on a daily basis. In addition, Safinah lacked charisma and energy, it felt she was in a rush to get everywhere so she could hang out with the other guides. On one occasion she dropped us off at a random table in the middle of nowhere to have our picnic lunch. After unpacking our food she said she had to get petrol - over two hours later she finally returned, surprised that we were eager to go do something with our day. These things might sound relatively petty as complaints but they are simply scratching the surface of an overall 6 day experience. 

Tanzania - the tour started incredibly well. We were having an amazing time. Our guide was fantastic, teaching us lots about the country and wildlife, we received unexpected accommodation upgrades and were having fabulous game drives. We thought Michael must be putting in extra effort to improve things after our poor Ugandan experience. However, this all came crashing down on the fourth night when we received a visit from the local tour manager. Turns out his small company had partnered with Mushra to deliver our safari tour. Yet, despite us having paid Mushra USD5400 for this component of the trip, the partner company had not received any compensation. Everything was being paid for out of their pocket and his funds had come to an end. He could not afford to continue our tour and Mushra were not sending any money through. Putting aside the fact it was a poor business decision on the Tanzanian partners behalf to commence a service that had no deposit paid, the unwillingness of Mushra to pay the money ultimately compromised our trip and the tour was cancelled by Michael half way through. At this time things really heated up. We received a text from Michael saying the tour had been cancelled - he did not apologise at any point or help us get back to Arusha. The Tanzanian tour manager then created a very distressing situation for us, we were taken to a private location and an attempt was made to coerce us into paying him in lieu of the payment he had not received from Mushra. The way this whole scenario played out was exceptionally threatening and we feared for our safety. With the help of a third party we did manage to get out of the situation and return to Arusha on our own account. At this point we are still fighting for a refund from Mushra of the services not received - however none of this will be taken by us, we have committed to giving this to the Tanzanian company in compensation for their loss. Ultimately we will have lost out on both the experience and expense of half of our trip - all because of Michael and Mushra¢®?s actions. 

As mentioned above, we recognise this is a long story with many elements that may make us seem difficult customers. All we can do to mitigate for this is suggest you look at our other reviews and contact us for more information - nothing of this sort has ever happened to us before. Unfortunately it really tainted our overall trip. 

We also suspect Michael Ahabwe (the owner of Mushra) will dispute our review. However we have proof of everything that took place and are happy to share more information directly with travellers. 

We do not recommend Mushra. "
Amy and John,US,Visited: August 2018,01-Sep-18,50-65,over 5 safaris,TravelPartners,2,"Poor selection of subcontracted safari guide, disorganized and inacurate information.","We selected Travel Partners Ltd. though not the most economical because of our initial correspondence with them.  Belen was good to work with and did her job well.  However, she was in a difficult position as her company was not as professional as she.  Most safari companies do not require 50% upfront as do Travel Partners.  Before leaving the U.S. we asked if a Bank (cashiers) check for the second half would be OK, and were told in writing that yes a check would be fine.  Once in Africa ready to begin our safari they informed that a check was not OK after all and asked for funds to be wired instead.  It is very difficult to wire internationally from the U.S. if not there to sign.  Travel Partners pushed Belen to push us for the wire everyday during our safari.  Most U.S. banks would not have been able to comply, fortunately we had an account at an institution that once all international requirements were met were able to wire. This issue was unnecessary, and caused needless stress.  --  We tailor planned a safari to visit several parks in Tanzania spending most of the time in Serengeti including the north Mara area to see the Wilde-beast crossing.  Our driver although pleasant was unprofessional and a very poor driver.  We had two vehicle accidents during our 5 day safari, one could have been very serious, both were driver related.  The vehicle and the driver had been subcontracted by Travel Partners.  The vehicle was only in fair condition, (it caused permanent damage to luggage).   One accident was a near head on collision at high speed with another safari vehicle (thick dust impaired sight), loss of exterior mirror and severe body damage to the entire length of the vehicle resulted from the accident.  It was that close to being very serious.  Due to the accidents, we had to ride with other safari drivers until our driver could repair our vehicle enough to continue.  We had two experiences in other safari vehicles with other drivers, both were far superior drivers to ours, and the vehicles were in better condition (they even had cold water in the cooler, we did not - sometimes we did not have water at all.)  A flight from central Serengeti to Zanzibar was part of our itinerary.  Our flight was to leave Serengeti at 11:00 a.m. and arrive Zanzibar at 2:00 p.m. via Arusha.  Although not the fault of Travel Partners, the flight was delayed both at Serengeti and in Arusha, so we arrived at 6:00 pm causing a loss of 4 hours in Zanzibar - Belen said she would try to get some compensation from the airline if possible. 
--In spite of the above mentioned incidents, we enjoyed the experience.  The accommodations  were charming, and we were able to see so many animals.  Serengeti is very beautiful!  
--Overall, I would suggest looking at another safari company to plan your safari.  The wonderful experience of being in Tanzania and the parks was not the result of Travel Partners, it was Tanzania itself.  A different company could enhance the experience rather than inhibit it.   "

We booked two safaris with them ( Hell's gate and Nakuru). We made the deal with Peter, and he charged us 50$ each for the driver and guide in Nakuru and another 50$ each for driving us to Hell's gate and hire a guide in there. The entrance fees and the bike rental were on us.
At Nakuru everything went all right , but when we arrived to Hell's gate they told us we had to pay for the guide. We called Peter and we explained him that we paid 100$ to him for the driving to Hell's gate but also for having a guide in there, and he just hung up the phone to us after saying the 100$ were just for the transportation. Even the guides from Hell's gate were shocked for what he was doing !!! Eventually, our driver, who was great, managed to talk to him and convince him to pay the guide, because we were already talking about coming back to Nakuru.
So my advice is: do not hire anything with them, or at least with Peter! He'll try to do the same!"
Ana Beatriz Alegre,ES,Visited: December 2017,25-Mar-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Flight & Safaris International Ltd,1,Ripped-off consumers,"For us this trip was very important, we have a job with normal salary and  Kenya and Tanzania is very expensive for us.. We were going saving enough time.
The first day we pay all money, 3000$ for 16 days and half. Land Rover Defender with roof tent and camping equipment.
We take the vehicle in Nairobi.
They gave us the damaged vehicle. 
We warn the same day that the turbo charger was not working. 
For the highway the car was going very very slowly. 
Neither the air conditioning was going. We were in time of great heat and we spent it very badly. 
The first day in Ngare Ndare there came a few mechanics to be looked of arranging it, but not at all. 
We could come to Samburu but they were following the problems. 
In Nakuru one day we were in two workshops and on the following day in three. Was fustrating¢®?. 

Finally, after several discussions, Winny  said us that she was obtaining a van for take us to Masai Mara  and there they would bring to us  the Defender two days later, arranged.  Windy say : Am paying for 3 days from today.and paying the driver.You will only pay for fuel and park fee for the car.
They brought to us a horrible van, without air, without usb to load mobiles and cameras, with the most uncomfortable seats, with the battered lights, and the driver with expired license as said to us a police officer who stopped us on the following day.

Well, the next day to arrive to Mara suprise !! the driver say us that he must to go away the next day, because his chief had not given him any more money.  
We call to flight and safaris and Windy did not make sure us either that they were going to bring to us the vehicle. 
We turned to Nairobi ready to speak with Windy.

And when we think that they returned all money because we had problems with the vehicle since the first day¢®? no, they only return us a part.. 
Incredible¢®? We pay for 3 days  land rover damaged, 3 days 140 $ day for a horrible van..150$ for a cross border documentation when we dont cross any border, and one night at Mara Sidai camp.

Well, after that, we had other problems because we were not finding  other companies that were renting a car to us, there were holidays, etc, etc¢®? but this is another history, jajajaja

I have whatsapps, pictures, bills, etc¢®? 

Our experience  was very very bad."
Ana Maria,BE,Visited: February 2016,02-Mar-16,35-50,2-5 safaris,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Far away from my last safari,"I would never choose Karibu again. Their priority is to fill all the seats and make money. They are not worried about our experience.  Tree cars left the agency on the same day with 5, 6 and 7 persons. People in the cars with 6 and 7 persons said they could barely move inside, travel was very uncomfortable and take pictures was possible just for the ones at the windows. The cars are very old. The roads in the parks are very bumpy and for this reason you just think how important is to have a good car when you are there. One of my lens released 3 small screws with the vibration and at the end of the trip my back was like crap. It is essential to have a good Jeep.
I shared the car with 3 young girls that spent 6 days taking selfies, delaying all trips and looking for ostrich. I was deeply interested in photography (the big 5 obviously). I love meeting people but in this situation... no match. If possible, avoid shared safaris and look for companies that personalise the safari. Freedom inside the car is essential.  Our driver Zak was very goodgood character, good person, good sense of humour and a good driver (very aggressive driving though). The food was very good and the camping facilities was good. The 6th day of safari was in reality just 2 hours inside the park. After lunch we were back to Nairobi. They avoid paying another entrance in the park (valid for 24hs)."
Anais,FR,Visited: September 2021,03-Jan-22,20-35,first safari,Bencia Africa Adventure & Safaris,1,Ruined Honeymoon,"We chose Bencia for a first safari experience during our honeymoon with a 6 days safari (2 full days in Masa? Mara + Nakuru + Hell's Gate, Nairobi to Nairobi).

Our initial plan had to be changed because of COVID test that we had to do at least the day before leaving. Bencia told me that last night we won't do in Naivasha/Hell's Gate but in Nairobi. What I didn't know was that we would have to sacrifice 1 full day and 1 night at Masa? Mara (which was of course the heart of our Safari) because of that. Of course they didn't tell me as day/night in Nairobi is not the same price as day/night in Masa? Mara. The safari cost didn't change at any moment.
The problem is that I never received any new plan, I think there was a real communication problem there from Bencia.

We only did one evening and full day next in Masa? Mara, not even the next morning as planned also because we had to be quickly to Nakuru for I do not know which reason because we arrived there at noon and left for safari at 6pm, all those lost hours we could have spent in Mara...

After this evening safari, I started contacting Bencia about our planning, they just said that we should do safari on the morning and head to Naivasha where we could do an activity that we would have to pay ourselves. I started to be angry and asked them (my contact was Alfred) why skipping one full day in Masa? Mara to be in Naivasha with nothing provided ? I asked them to provide us an activity as I was the one being stole and of course they first refuse. They even said that they would offer me activities in Nairobi and Hell's Gate, they are very funny in this so called ''company''. I paid for a 6 days safari, got stolen a day in Masa? Mara in exchange of one day in Nairobi but they continued talking about offering me things that I paid for... After a long discussion, I finally had a word from Bencia saying they would pay activity in Naivasha !

The next day, after only a few hours of safari in Nakuru (driver always had good excuses to quickly end the day or push us to do extra activity), we arrived in Naivasha. Other surprise there, we were not in the good hotel and when I compared rates of 2 hotels, 1 night in the one that was supposed to be booked was at USD 430 and the one we were in at USD 165. I gently asked for an explanation and a change or an upgrade during a long moment but Bencia never wanted to upgrade us, saying that it was the ''same level''. What a kind gift from them for our honeymoon !

We arrived in this hotel at 11:35 am and I had to struggle once again with Bencia (still Alfred who didn't want to get me his manager)@ to get our promised activity. Finally, at 17:00 after that our driver disapeared (even Bencia couldnt reach him) we were taken to our 1 hour boat ride, finally !

Last but not least, when we arrived at 3pm for check in in Nairobi without having any lunch, we discovered that Bencia booked only bed and breakfast. Reminder : I paid and signed and they signed to a contract for 6 days saying that all meals were included. There, once again, I had to fight during 2 hours to get our lunch (at 5pm bon app?tit !) and also dinner.

This is where we met Cyprian from Bencia who listened to this story and tried to get us our meals and organized excursion the day after (of course Alfred from Bencia lied to me saying that he had booked excursions in Nairobi so we missed elephant orphanage).

Thanks to Cyprian, last day we were able to go to Nairobi NP for a last safari. That does not compensate at all the rest but I guess we will never received anything from them.

If you want an unbelievable experience, especially for honeymoon, I would not recommend Bencia, they are not tousism professionals. I would have done much more organizing it myself from Paris than them from Nairobi.

PS : Next to this comment, Bencia contacted me to remove my comment in exchange of some money, that tells the level of such company..."
Anders,UK,Visited: November 2015,21-Feb-16,65+,2-5 safaris,Pam Tours and Travel Ltd,2,Masai Mara where fantastic. Hells gate and Lake Nakuro was not much to see.,"We were lead to believe that we have bought a Safari for four people in our own car. Instead we were picking up and dropping off people all the time at Transfer Hotel. This lead to many hours of unnecessary transports on very bad roads.
The driver was good at finding game with the help of the radio. But his communications skills needs a lot of improvement. He did not tell us where we were going and what will happen next. The first lunch stop was totally unnecessary. Who eats lunch at 4 pm? Because of that we missed the bird trip at Lake Navisha."
Andoni,FR,Visited: December 2018,15-Dec-18,20-35,over 5 safaris,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,1,"Plan not respected, lies, never been to Masai Triangle, not real Masai Mara Park.","Absolute joke:
- We¢®?ve been asked to pay cash.
- The manager asked us to give a good review afterward, before the Safari even started.
- The driver in ¢®¡ÆMasai Mara¢®¡¾ spent his all time on the phone and gave us very very very few information
- He also drove very dangerously because the Rangers were ¢®¡Æchasing us¢®¡¾. We were on a restricted area
- We also spent an entire day in the car transferring to Masai Mara to Lake Nakuru (the driver refused to do a morning or evening game drive, and on top of that he dared to say I ¢®¡Æasked for more time to sleep in the morning¢®¡¾)
- We discovered during dinner with other tourists that are used to Safaris, that the Masai Mara site we visited was actually a very very small part of the park. We had actually never been inside the Masai Triangle.

I can see that I¢®?m not the only tourist to complain about this agency. Other customers complained on TripAdvisor.
I honestly think that this is a scam.

We were supposed to meet them at 9am in the hotel, he arrived by 10 am with another couple saying he had a problem with another driver(probably a lie) and told us we had to share the safari, although we had paid for private safari. Finally we went to Masai Mara, we had our game drives and when we were leaving the camp site on the final day we were told we could not leave because the company hadn¢®?t paid our stay. So to be able to leave we had to pay AGAIN for something it was already included. Terrible company, don¢®?t even think to book with them."
Andrew,KE,Visited: August 2022,24-Aug-22,20-35,over 5 safaris,Lenchada Safaris,2,Worst ever experience,"As expats in Kenya, we have taken many safari trips, and the recent one to Masai Mara with Lenchada was unfortunately our worst ever experience. We chose this company out of their overwhelmingly good reviews on safaribookings.com. That probably means that most of their drivers are excellent. But our driver, named Tony, was an exception by a large margin.

Tony clearly hates his job and was cold and rude to us throughout the trip. Every time we met at the beginning of a game drive, he never greeted us and only responded to our greeting with a node. He never helped with our luggage either. During game drives, he never asked us or even notified us before starting the vehicle after a stop, never caring if we wanted to stay for longer. In several cases this interrupted our ongoing photography of animals, and sometimes even worse?the abrupt move of the vehicle on the bumpy road of Masai Mara caused us to fall on the seat. All three of us hit our knees on the armrest of the seats for a few times, and we all got bruises. Having paid a little more to take a private tour rather than a shared one, we expected that we could customize the game drives to a reasonable extent. When we tried to communicate with him about our preferences in animal viewing, however, Tony responded impatiently with cold words such as ¢®¡ÆYou have to be patient,¢®¡¾ ¢®¡ÆI have to follow instructions from the radio.¢®¡¾

And his words about following the radio turned out to be a lie, because his vehicle was not equipped with a radio! A radio is important for any safari trip, and especially for Masai Mara, since the natural reserve is simply too large. Even during the migration season, most part of Masai Mara at any given time would still be empty, and without a radio, on which dozens of drivers share their findings real-time, you will very likely end up not finding anything interesting for a whole hour. Two of the three of us fell asleep for around twenty to thirty minutes during the game drive. In the past we have taken safari trips in less renowned destinations and during low seasons, but the experiences have never been so boring for us that we fell asleep. It may be unbelievable that this happened in Masai Mara during the migration season, but when you don¢®?t see any noteworthy animal for dozens of minutes it would be hard to stay awake. We did get to see some big cats, but that was only possible when we luckily encountered another vehicle that had radio, whose driver kindly shared the information, and our vehicle then made a U-turn to go back in the opposite direction for some fifteen minutes to get to the spot. With a radio we would probably have spent thirty minutes less to get there.

When we realized this problem, we contacted Alex, the managing person of Lenchada. Alex was responsive and attentive. He apologized for our experience, clarified that the driver¢®?s practice of not carrying radio to a game drive is intolerable and against the company¢®?s rules, and told us that he will soon make a thorough check on all the vehicles of his company to make sure that they must have radios. For us, however, the only thing he could offer as a remedy was to extend our final game drive by departing the lodge one hour earlier than planned. We appreciated his supportive attitude and accepted the offer, understanding that it was probably already all he could do within his capability. Tony was late, cutting the extended game-drive time from one hour to less than forty minutes. But the length of the trip turned out not a big issue, because during that extended final game drive, we again fell asleep, for the simple reason that the vehicle still didn¢®?t have radio and we still had not much to see most of the time. 

Although Tony had no radio, he attempted to cheat us by saying that he had one. It was only during the second day of the trip, when we heard him responding to another driver asking about information on animal spotting, saying in Swahili ¢®¡ÆSina redio¢®¡¾ (I don¢®?t have a radio) that we realized he had been lying. When we contacted Alex about this concern, Alex hosted a three-way phone call with us and Tony. To our surprise, in the phone call Tony lied to his boss and insisted that he had a radio which he simply turned off because it was noisy. On our way back to Nairobi, Tony even blamed us for telling his boss about the radio issue, and still insisted that he has radio. When we pointed to the antenna holder in the front of his vehicle, where there was no antenna at all, he said that for some vehicles the antenna is in the back. But one only needs to get off the vehicle and look at its back to know that there¢®?s no antenna there either. For so many times, Tony lied through his teeth.

Tony also told us that because of our complaint, he was going to lose his job. Due to his repetitive blatant lies, we would not believe in what he said. But if what he said is indeed true, that would be an indication that Lenchada really cared about their customers and promptly fired this unprofessional, dishonest, and rude employee. Such a person should simply not be allowed to work in this industry.

In other aspects of our trip that are unrelated to the driver, our experience was mostly positive. For example, the lodge was a good balance of quality and price. It is way cheaper than any accommodation inside Masai Mara, yet it¢®?s only a ten-minute drive to the gate. Since their boss Alex is a responsible and honest person, and since there are many good reviews out there, choosing Lenchada for your safari may still be a good idea. But you have to make sure that your driver is not Tony, otherwise all those good reviews will be totally irrelevant to your actual experience."
Andrew,US,Visited: July 2015,10-Apr-16,35-50,2-5 safaris,Viva Safaris,2,Overall good experience but very dependent on which safari guide you are given,"The tremisana lodge was a little tired and basic (compared to other lodges I've stayed in before).but the staff at the lodge were very friendly and helpful.  The Dutch lady (I can't remember her name) who was the manager at the lodge was absolutely lovely and very warm and friendly. The safari guides were very variable.  We had a day safari to Kruger with James who was absolutely outstanding.  He is the best safari guide I have ever had. He was knowledgeable and worked tirelessly to find wildlife for us. He was truly excellent.  I can't recommend him highly enough
Murray, was also an excellent guide and knowledgable and enthusiastic.  

We had a morning safari walk with Philip, however, which was very poor indeed.  He seemed totally uninterested and the entire morning was very dull and I would not recommend doing this with him.  
We also did a sunset drive with Rex.  What should have been a nice evening safari drive was ruined by our guide, Rex. He was obviously upset at the vehicle he had been assigned and spent the drive complaining about the organisation of the company and the poor state of the vehicle.   We then stopped for a drink to watch the sunset and he spent this entire 30 mins or so complaining to us about viva safaris, their organisation, the staff, the lack of investment and how he had used to work in 5star lodges that were much superior.  I found this odd and very unprofessional.  If he had an issue with his bosses etc then I would expect him to discuss this directly with them and not spend a few hours moaning to us about it.  In summary, I think safaris are good here if you are lucky and get a good guide (James or Murray from my experience). But I would be careful because if given a poor guide in my opinion it can really spoil the safari."
Andrew,US,Visited: January 2019,01-Apr-19,35-50,first safari,Love Uganda Safaris,1,Worst experience ever,"We went with this company on back to back days¢®?1 in Zanzibar and 1 in Kenya. On day 1, we were supposed to swim with dolphins and sea turtles. We were also supposed to have time to explore Jozani Forest. Instead, we spent most of the day in the bus (2+ hours of it were with it not moving). We had a short stop at a beach, but were told we had to make it quick to make it to our lunch reservation at The Rock Restaurant. We were assured that we would get a chance to swim with dolphins and sea turtles afterwards. While the meal was nice, it was very disorganized. After the meal was over, it took Marl approximately an hour to settle up the bill with each person in the group. Rather than spending an hour at the restaurant, it ended up being 2 hours which further pushed things behind. We were then told we wouldn¢®?t be able to stop for dolphins because it was too hot for them. I found out later friends of ours with a different company did swim with dolphins. We were then given a choice of aquarium to see the sea turtles, Jovani Forest or go straight to the cruise ship we came in on. If we chose the turtles, we wouldn¢®?t have time to swim with them. We chose Jovani Forest. We only had 20 minutes there due to the disorganization. We had to stay close by due to the short amount of time. Luckily, we did see a few monkeys. So¢®?our group of 4 spent over $400 for a glorified meal, 20 minutes at a forest that we didn¢®?t get to explore much of, and hours on a hot bus.

Since the company is from Kenya, we gave them the benefit of the doubt. We expected the next day to go smoother. We got off the ship and made our way to the Jeeps. We were told before the day started it would go smoother. We were told we would load up the jeeps in order of arrival and each jeep would leave immediately once filled. Did that happen? Nope. We waited an hour before getting started with the long drive to Tsavo East. Once there, we had to wait another hour and a half to get in because of ¢®¡Æsystem error¢®¡¾. Even though there was a ¢®¡Æsystem error¢®¡¾ there were still other people going into the park who were with other tour groups. The safari itself was nice. We saw lots of animals. When it came time to leave though, I¢®?m pretty sure our driver got lost. We didn¢®?t leave the park until nearly an hour after the rest of our group had left the park. A lunch at Voi Lodge was supposed to be included. We were supposed to go to Masai Village. All of that was cut out. 

Everything that went wrong on both days always had an excuse that was blamed on someone or something else rather than taking responsibility for their mistakes or their miscommunication. There was no attempt to reconcile what was promised to be included but wasn¢®?t. There was no offer of a partial refund for the things we were supposed to do but didn¢®?t get to do. We felt like we were taken advantage of. We felt like we were lied to. We felt like we were scammed. This is a company that I highly recommend others to AVOID!

I found their tour preperation was not adequate, leading to a car break-down which cost us several hours. Not good when your time is limited. Some more time was wasted in a Police control, where it turned out that the car did not have proper insurance with some documentation missing. The driver was definitely striving to do his best, yet he was not qualified as a guide during our game drive. Fortunately and by chance we had a local helping out, otherwise we would have missed lots of interesting sights and information."

DRIVER/GUIDE TOOK THE TICKET MONEY FOR HIMSELF.
I ordered 3 days safari in the private car during my few days stay in Kenya with pickup from Nairobi. On the 1st day driver/guide stopped the car at a certain distance before the park entry gate and informed me that the entry fee can only be paid in cash. He mentioned that card terminal is broken and Bonfire should inform me about it. When I proposed we can go together and buy tickets he said someone should stay with the car. When he was back, I asked for the ticket and¢®? surprise another failure, ticked machine is broken and that I will get the ticked on the exit two days later. When I messaged bonfire office asking if this is normal, I only get the info that they will check this and that was the end of communication. Two days later at exit I asked to stop at the gate to ¢®?take some photos¢®?. I asked at the counter about card payment and the clerk told me ¢®?it¢®?s working all the time, every day¢®?. When I confronted back the driver he said that clerk is lying and he promised me the ticked when we will arrive back to my hotel. At the end he was trying to give me a ticked with someone else¢®?s name on it and with the date from previous month. Clear scam were driver keeps entry fee for himself and no ticked is issued.

3 DAY RIDE IS ACTUALLY ONE DAY RIDE. POOR CAR CONDITION
Itinerary is more or less like this. First and last day is ?6h drive from and to Nairobi. Rest of the time should be the game ride.
What I get in reality was 2h ride on day 1 and full day ride on day 2. Day 3 was just rush ride to the gate without even opening the roof. I can say only day 2 was game drive however the driver didn¢®?t even know how to use 4x4 (other guides were trying to explain this to him) and therefore we lost some time rolling in the mud and taking d-tours. Car also had several issues, engine was going out frequently, wipers were not working, driver had to stop and use bottled water to clean window, overall problem with electric, no radio and antena. On top of that Day 3 was real failure, driver proposed we will first take breakfast in the lodge and then do the game ride. What really happen after breakfast we rushed to the exit without even opening the roof, it took 25 min maximum. There was no game ride on that day. On the way to Nairobi, driver almost killed a pedestrian because he was overtaking other cars using roadside!

BONFIRE OFFICE COVERING THE SCAM
After my return I escalated all above concerns to the bonfire office, only after several emails I got response that they will reimburse half of the entry ticket price, less than 5% of total price. Till today after 4 months I didn¢®?t get any refund, all I was getting for the first month were excuses that I have to have local bank account or that driver can bring cash to the hotel (they know I¢®?m a tourist and not leaving in KE). When I told bonfire they can reimburse the same way as I paid, this is credit card, I got well known response, reimbursement to cred card is broken :D:D:D
Apparently scam with no issuing entry ticket is common, however bonfire supporting this and trying to cover this up is way below any standard. I have all pictures of fake tickets or email exchange with excuses."
Angelica,CA,Visited: October 2019,05-Nov-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,African Wanderlust Adventures,1,Awful experiences,"Robert at Wanderlust promised me a tour with two nights in the Serengeti, and after arrival, he made up a sob story about why the tour had to be cancelled and tried to push my child and I to take a generic tour. We had just been to Masai Mara and weren't desperate to see the Serengeti, so I said No. I initially felt sorry for him, even though he'd messed up the dates we were supposed to be in the Serengeti in his ""story,"" so I agreed to take it day by day and perhaps go on day trips with his company.

Before our first trip, we agreed that I'd pay by Western Union, just as I'd done for the deposit, but then he emailed to say he preferred Cash to exchange into USD to pay for our park entry fee. Initially, I preferred this over using my limited US$, but as it got later and later into the evening, I emailed to say I would give 100 USD to his driver tomorrow for the park entry fee. He wouldn't take No for an answer, saying he needed the cash Now to pay for the park fee online, and showed up at my hotel around 9:30 pm. He said we'd just be going to the ""nearest ATM,"" but after we got in the car, we passed by ATM after ATM. More than twenty minutes later, he pointed at the exact ATM he wants me to use and waits outside. Luckily, the machine wouldn't let me take more than 350 USD, and he let us leave. It felt like we'd been kidnapped by loan sharks and forced to go to an ATM. On the way back to the hotel, he greedily counted the cash while talking non-stop on the phone. Very scary.

Via email, we were then informed that instead of 6-7 am, we'd be picked up at 5:40 am the next day. Then at 5:00 am, the lady from the hotel knocked on my door to say the driver was here. The name of the driver was different from the one I'd been given, so I had the hotel staff take down the license plate number. The van then picked up a couple who'd book through another middleman and were told their pick-up time would be 5:10. We then arrived at a camp to join a couple who were on a 3-day safari, but were told they be waking up in about an hour. This couple had booked through yet another company, and the safari itself was operated by another company in an almost unmarked safari jeep.

It turns out that nobody had informed the safari driver that the first couple had to be at the airport at  a certain time. So our time on the actual safari was cut short to accomodate this.

Although we still had 50 USD with Robert, for safety reasons, we opted to leave Arusha as soon as possible. I sent him a Paypal request for money, but we never saw those 50 dollars again."

I was supposed to go to Tarengire, Serengeti and Ngorongoro crater with an experienced guide-driver. The first day, we went to Lake Manyara (huh???) with a ??guide driver?? that didn¢®?t know the place ( he kept going around in circles until we pointed this out, with pictures to prove it) or the animals (he tried to brush up with some borrowed notes when he thought we weren¢®?t looking). The next day, he drive too fast, missed a bend and ended up ploughing through a ridge. While the passengers were more scared than anything else, he apparently damaged the radiator. The last part of the very long drive to a Serengeti campground was dangerous for the cook and driver, since they had to get out and refill the radiator several times. The last was in the dark, and we discovered afterwards that a mother lion and her three cubs had been very close. We arrived very late to the campground. The cook managed everything (setting up the tents, calling for another vehicle, cooking a very late meal) while the driver pretend to be busy. Big Five did not call to let us know about a replacement vehicle. I had been in contact with the people who I booked with, and they put pressure on Big Five. The next day, we had another car and driver (yaaay) and the day after yet another. The people I booked were surprised to find out that I had not gone to Tanengire. They came and got me and took me to Tanengire instead of an initially planned cultural visit.

Anna,ET,Visited: May 2021,06-May-21,20-35,2-5 safaris,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Not professionnal or serious enough,"I booked two different safari tours with this company. I had to pay cash for the 2 tours and the tour operator applies a strange conversion rate (440$ -> 48400 KES). I did'nt complain at the time. 

The first tour was a 3 days in Masai Mara tour - safari joining group it went quite well, especially thanks to our guide James who really did his best to help us find the Big Five. 
However, we didn't get water as planned on the website. When I asked the company, they put responsability on the guide. 

The second tour was a One Day solo in Amboselithe guide was supposed to pick me up at 5am at the hotel. He arrived at 5:40 because of a technical problem with the car. This car was so old that it was already amazing that it could still drive. The first guide drove at a gas station and I had to wait for another 15 minutes for a second driver to come and pick me up. A lunch box was supposed to be included so we could have lunch in the park but it was'nt. So we headed to the park and had nothing to eat before 5 pm, at a gas station, when we came back to Nairobi. 

When I wrote to the tour operator to complain and ask for compensation, they didn't even bother to answer and at least apologize.

I know I booked cheap tours, but even when it's cheap you can expect the basic professionalism from a tour operator.

When we arrived we were in shock for the location, we asked to be moved immediately and Mr. Mika told us to pay for the upgrade. For 2 days in Lenchada Camp we had the electricity just for 3h per day,  was from 7pm to 10 pm, in the tend wasn¢®?t plate for recharge the cell phone. We booked for 2 persons for 1.700 dollars for 5 days, full board, includes Breakfast/ Lunch/Dinner/Drinking water. Driver/Camp/Hotel/Safari/National Park.
We had to recharge in the fake restaurant (was a small a dirty tend, and the food was terrible, the chef wearing very dirty). No electricity, no water to drink in the camp. We never meet Mr. Mika, he staid away from us.
In the our tour for 5 day were with us others 5 persons. One paid 550 dollars for Lenchada Camp where Mr Mika accomodated us, and the others 4 paid 600 dollars each for a good location in Enrock Camp.
Thanks to the driver for our safari Mr. Andrew from other company we recovered the shock of the terrible first 2 days in Lenchada Camp.
We give the good reviews for the driver Mr. Andrew, and bad reviews for Akoa Africa Tour and Mr. Mika from this company.

Anonymous,US,Visited: October 2021,02-Nov-21,20-35,first safari,African Adventure Specialists,1,Thiefs and liars,"The three of us selected a ten day trip around Uganda. We paid two thirds of the total, told to cover the remaining third upon arrival. Once we arrived, we were taken to ATM's several times almost every morning, to take out the third half and pay in cash. We explained multiple times that we would not be able to take out that much and can wire money instead but our guide refused and kept asking us to take out cash, even asking us to overpay at a lodge so they could reimburse that amount back to the guide.

We told our guide several times we did not want a boat tour. It was not part of our itinerary. On the day we had scheduled game drives all day, they took us to lunch then told us to hurry through lunch to make the boat tour. 

After we paid our initial deposit, our guide changed several lodging options. They explained 'it was the equivalent.' One lodge was $125USD a night but they changed it to a $16USD a night lodge. When we arrived at our $16USD night lodge, the guide told us to check in then LEFT. We couldn't check in because it was too early and our guide had left with our bags. They came back two hours later- no explanation or apologies. 

Prior to arrival, we were told several times to bring items to donate to an orphanage. On the day we were set to meet the kids, our guide brought us back to our lodging then told us since it was a holiday, the kids had gone home to their families. ..but it's an orphanage? We were forced to give all our items ($300USD) to the lodging manager and are not entirely sure where the items went.

Over the entire trip, our guide was consistently late and left us alone in our vehicle in large cities (without telling us where they'd be). We brought this up but there was no change. 
When we went for game drives, they would stop and take photos themselves, then continue on. They never checked in to see if we had a good view or got all our photos. 
In addition, our guide made three stops during our drive to visit friends. They would stop the car, hop out and chat with the person for several minutes, then hop back in. No explanation or apologies for the delay in time. At one point, both guides asked us if we wanted to stop and shop. We said no, but they still left us in the car and went shopping themselves. 

On the last day, our guide had initially promised a lunch before a ride to the airport however, the night before they decided they'd only take us to the airport.

Overall, we realized we overpaid for the trip we wanted and especially for the trip we got. We feel like we were fully taken advantage of and are unsure of the integrity/legitimacy of this company.

I absolutely recommend against the 2 days 1 night tour to Masai Mara as the total game drive was 2.45h for both days. It's simply unacceptable. I have been to daily safaris of 5-6h of game drive.

Some good things though: My guide was great, the accommodation and food were good for being a budget safari.

Tour happened as follows:
Day 1: pick-up at 7am in Nairobi. Departure at 8am. Arrival at camp at 3pm. Game drive started at 5pm. It finished at 6.30pm.
Day 2: pick-up at 6.15am. Game drive starts at 6.45am. Game drive ended at 8.30am. I arrived at Nairobi at 3pm.

The drive from Nairobi to Camp will never be less than 6h and it can be up to 8h,

Take at least the 3 day tour or don't do it!

For respect for your time and well-being it is a brutal waste of time, money and energy don't do a 2 days 1 night tour. It was so frustrating to have ended a 2 day tour at 8.30am! I was shocked.

They never offer to refund partially or offered a discount for another safari.
I cannot recommend Jocky Agency. Avoid them!"
Antonio,US,Visited: July 2016,28-Aug-16,20-35,first safari,Visit Mount Kenya Tours,1,Worst experience ever ! Total scam.,"We met with mr. Rufus in Kenya to discuss our tour and our accommodations. We booked luxury tented camp accommodations during our safari and when we met with Rufus he told us the reservations for these camps were confirmed and we paid him. However on our first day of safari we got dropped off at a different very low budget tent camp which was not the camp he promised us we would stay at. 2 days later we went to a different national park and also there Rufus had arranged a totally different accommodation (less expensive and more basic) than was described in the booking. The last two days we would go to amboselli national park and we were supposed to stay at kibo Safari camp. However on our drive there we asked our driver where we would stay and suprisingly he was told to take us to a very low budget, crappy tented camp. We called Rufus to discuss this problem (again) and he told us we were on a waiting list for kibo camp. We didn't believe him and called Kibo camp ourselves and they told us they had plenty of tents available and they never had been in contact with ""visit mount Kenya tours"" or someone named Rufus. As Rufus was not answering his phone anymore we told our driver to go to kibo camp. Eventually the driver paid our first overnight there as Rufus was not responding to any calls. However the next day we called Rufus again and he was very aggressive and yelling that we costed him too much money and he wasn't going to pay our last night accommodation (even though we already payed him for a 6 day safari in advance. In the end we had to stay at the kimana amboselli tented camps, the camp Rufus wanted to accommodate us in the first place. This was the worst place I ever stayed. The toilets were disgusting with bugs in them, as was the shower (cold). Furthermore we both got sick from the food, as did others in the camp and our tent was full of holes and the sheets of the bed were full of stains. In shortdon't travel with this tour operating company, it's a complete scam !! "
Antony Kurian,AE,Visited: August 2019,20-Aug-19,50-65,2-5 safaris,Lians Travel Africa,1,A worst travel experience ever !!!,"We were a group of 14 people (5 families) from Dubai who planned to visit Kenya from August 12 to 17 ,2019 ,through' Lians travel Africa ' . This tour operator was selected because she showed the lowest quote and best itinerary.                               We started communicating with Ms.Lilian, operation manager concerning parks, places, accommodations,vehicle.....about 6 months before the safari started and made an agreed contract for touring in Kenyya for 5 nights and 6 days for 14 people. We were made to pay 25% the initial booking amount as advance.  As soon as we landed Kenya we paid the rest of the amount leaving a small balance to be paid at the end of the trip.We could sense some trouble in the beginning itself.  We got the message fromMs.Lilian,4 days before our date of travel,saying our hotel bookings are cancelled.  But later on she confirmed that every thing is done as per the agreed contract. During the first 3 days of our trip, our valuable safari time was wasted due  to  the issues between the drivers and agency, on 3rd day they changed the vehicles and drivers.  But it took a very bad shape when we reached Masaai mara on 4th day.  We were made to pay accommodation charges. What was more shocking was on 5th day we were left stranded without food and accommodation.  Finally we had to find out a camp on our own, had to pay the park fees.etc....       we would not recommend to use Lian Travel agency services as they focus more on trying to cheat and get the most money from clients than increasing customer satisfaction/experience.

Archibald Haddock,UK,Visited: February 2019,21-Mar-19,50-65,2-5 safaris,Orongai Africa Safari,1,Don't even think about it,"Short story: cheats, crooks and unprofessional. Avoid this outfit like the plague. They offered us a price of 2150$/pp and three days before the trip they increased it in 650$/pp. Finally we were forced to pay 200$ extra and downgraded us from lodges to mobile tented camps.

Long story¢®? It¢®?s a long review, but I wanted to give all the details. If you are thinking of dealing with this people, I strongly advice you read on.

In December 2018 we got a quote from Orongai for a 7-day safari in northern Tanzania: Ngorongoro, Ndutu and Serengueti, for 8 people, all lodges. From February 16th to 22nd 2019. The price was 2,150 $ per person, total 17,200 $. I will send the quotation to anybody interested. Park fees, All accommodations, all transportation, and all Taxes/VAT were explicitly included. All lodges were mid/upper level: Lake Duluti Lodge, Ngorongoro Serena Safari Lodge, Ndutu Safari Lodge and Serengeti Serena Safari Lodge. 

The price was lower than others we had (first clue) and included a flight back from Serengeti¢®?s airstrip to Arusha the last day, which was the clincher: ¢®¡ÆAround midmorning join a scheduled flight from Seronera airstrip to Arusha airport.¢®¡¾ (sic). So, we agreed to this quotation: 2,150 $ pp.

In January 2018 we all paid a 30% (645 $ pp) by bank transfer. The remainder was to be paid on arrival in cash. The remainder was: 2,150 - 645= 1,505 $ per person, or 12,040 $ total. Two of us decided (stupidly, it turned out) to pay also our part of the remainder beforehand by transfer: 3,010 $ for two people. After this payment the remainder was: 12,040 ? 3,010 = 9,030 $, for the other 6 people (who decided to pay their remainder on arrival).

On February 12th I received the following message from Martha, the person in charge of our trip: ¢®¡Æjust wanted to inform you that there is additional 650$ per person this is due to additional concetion fees at NDUTU area and Ngorongoro area that we¢®?re not there before. We apologize for the inconveniences coursed¢®¡¾ (sic).

Cursed indeed! This left us all worried, to put it mildly. It followed a frenzied interchange of emails with the said Martha, trying to understand the extra 650 $ pp, a 30% increase! We checked with TANAPA and other authorities and there had been no increase of any park fees for more than a year. Finally, after many, many messages back and forth Martha wrote to me: ¢®¡ÆYes, I received the transfers and the cost is 2150$ per person plus the hotel payments fees 650$ per person. The total is 2,800$ per person¢®¡¾ (sic)

We considered not going, but we really wanted to do the safari, we had already paid 645$ each (or 2,150 $ some of us) plus the flights, a dear price for us, and we decided to go (another mistake). We contacted the lodges where we were supposed to stay to confirm the reservation. They confirmed it, but at least one of them called Orongai to tell them we were asking.

On arrival we had a very long and very unpleasant discussion with Martha, a guide called Asseri and another guide Freddy (who, unbeknownst to us, spoke a bit of Spanish, but much less than he thinks). We tried to convince them to honor their original offer, but reasoning with them was impossible. They denied evidence and the most basic logic stone-faced. It was like talking to a wall. They said for instance that the word ¢®¡ÆTotal¢®¡¾ next to the 17,200 $ didn¢®?t mean ¢®¡Æall the money¢®¡¾. They insisted that the remainder was 12,030 $, and not 9,030 $ as we said, because of the additional charges of 650 $ per person. Which doesn¢®?t even add up! If we had to pay an extra 650$ the remainder would be 14,230$. They further informed us that the flight back from Serengeti to Arusha was not included in the price, even if ¢®¡ÆAll transportation¢®¡¾ was explicitly included, because a flight is not ¢®¡Ætransportation¢®¡¾!

We called the Spanish embassy for advice. They put us in contact with a person in Arusha, who sometimes helped other Spaniards informally. He has more than 20 years of experience in the safari business himself. He was extremely, awfully kind. He tried to convince Orongai¢®?s people for maybe another hour. He couldn¢®?t. 

Finally, we decided to take it to the ¢®¡ÆTourist Police¢®¡¾, an institution created to deal with cases like this. We went there, a concrete bungalow in the outskirts of Arusha, bare of any official look or sign that I could see, and met with an official, a guy just dressed in jeans and a polo. We spent there another 2 hours, repeating everything to him (Orongai¢®?s people speaking mostly in Swahili even if we repeatedly asked them not to). He initially seemed to lean to our side, but finally, probably tired of the whole thing, told all of us that this was not a criminal dispute and that we had to resolve the thing among ourselves. And left. So much for the Tourist Police. During this, we offered to pay 200 $/person over the agreed 2,150 $. Orongai rejected this.

We went back to the hotel at around 11 pm. We were leaning to cancel the whole thing and leave. Mind you, in the middle of the night, without a car and without a hotel, because the lodge we were in, Lake Duluti Lodge, told us that we would have to pay our rooms ourselves (~ 300 $/room) because Orongai wouldn¢®?t pay if we canceled the safari. At this, Martha threatened us with legally/judicially demanding whole payment (her amount not ours), even if the safari didn¢®?t go ahead, because ¢®¡Æit would be our decision to cancel¢®¡¾.

After even more discussion, somebody suggested (I don¢®?t remember who) that if we paid the 9,030 $ we still owed, PLUS the 200 $/person we offered before AND they downgraded us to mobile tented camps, instead of lodges, we could go ahead. Tired of the whole thing, and worried of what a judicial process in Tanzania would entail, we agreed to this. They, then, made us sign a paper saying that these changes were our responsibility because we had not understood the original quotation correctly. Without this condition, they threatened again, the deal was off and they would sue us for full payment. Some of us signed, under duress obviously. So that you understand this downgrade, a mobile tented camp is a far cry from a permanent camp, let alone a lodge. Some permanent tented camps are really luxurious. The mobile tented camps are most definitely NOT luxurious. In some, the showers didn¢®?t even work, and didn¢®?t have enough power even to recharge the batteries/phones if we all tried at the same time.

A very suggestive thing happened at the Tourist Police. Martha, to convince us that 2,150 $/pp was an impossible price, listed in a piece of paper, from memory, the actual cost of each item: car rental, several park fees, lodge fees, food, water, everything. The total came exactly to 17,000 $. This shows that they know the cost of everything by heart, and that the quotation they gave us WAS NOT just a mistake they made, as we thought at some point. This clearly shows that this was a deliberate and, more importantly, practiced scheme to cheat clients. Mine is not the only story like this. Check the comments on Orongai in the web, many of the negative ones are from people with relatively ¢®¡Æhigh level¢®¡¾ safaris. The ones that may be amenable to pay extra when confronted with problems. Another suggestive detail is something our friend said. That, at least the Ndutu lodge (there is only the one) was almost certainly full by September already! That by December, when Orongai supposedly made the reservation, it would be utterly im-po-ssi-ble to get four double rooms there for mid-February. Possibly the others too. This makes me suspect that some reservations didn¢®?t exist. Instead, tented camps are easier to get at short notice. I sincerely believe that if we had paid the 650 $ extra, we would have still ended up either in lower-category lodges or in tented camps. Something that has happened to some clients of Orongai.

About the safari itself, one of the guides was nice (Freddy), the other (Asseri) wasn¢®?t at all. He never made any effort to place the car in a good position for the photos and barely spoke at all. Both were a bit risky drivers. Especially Asseri who frequently texted on his phone while driving, took photos or even video putting his full arm outside the window. Some of the seat belts were either broken or ""repaired"" with a knot. The lunch food was quite poor and always the same, including a piece of chicken so deeply fried as to be mummified. Almost inedible.

All said, what most vexed me, far beyond the extra cost and the downgrade, was that it half-ruined the whole trip. The preparations, the pre-travel excitement (one of the best things), were all erased in a flurry of worry and anger. A lot of the time while we were there talking about it¢®? it all embittered an experience that should have been exhilarating and special. They robed us of that.

Before the travel we contacted TATO (of which Orongai is supposed to be a member); Tanzania Tourism (government office) and TANAPA, asking about our problem. Only TANAPA answered. TATO and Tanz. Tourism didn¢®?t deign. The American Society of Travel Advisors confirmed that Orongai is not a member, contrary to what it says in safaribookings.com

Archna Singh,UK,Visited: August 2016,18-Aug-16,35-50,over 5 safaris,Love Africa Safaris,1,An absolutely horrible experience.,"Hi, I had booked a tour with them in 2014 for a 26 day tour to Botswana. I had paid a sum of $30,700  to them. Unfortunately, I had visa issues and due to that the agent said he will adjust it next year and also the fact that he will apply the visa from his end. Next year, we waited and waited as we had sent all documents to him, but the visa never came in 2015 also. When I went to the embassy again in 2016 as so much of my life savings was stuck, I was shocked to know that he had never applied for my visa to begin with. I was informed by the immigration officer that he has clearly cheated me. I wrote a safari review and due to their intervention, he decided to adjust my holiday again next year. Finally my visa came in July 2016 and Calvin Machekano of Love Africa Safaris said that due to non availability of lodges, he will have to book new lodges and took an additional $8615 from us. We really didnt have a choice as $30700  was already given to him earlier which now brought the total amount to approx $40,000. 

I am a photographer and had requested a landcruiser for myself. Anyway after arriving there, much to our shock, a 30 year old broken vehicle with no floor and holes and a ten inch platform to sit on and totally open from all sides was provided to us by his representative and guide, Steven Bond Mubi, which we were expected to do our surface transport to various parks (some of them 6-7 hours away) as well as safaris for the next 25 days. Upon concern, we were threatened by this guide that he will not go with us. But as a woman, to travel on highways in such a vehicle when we had paid for something else was unacceptable. Upon contacting Calvin of Love Africa Safaris he failed to do anything about it and insisted that we go in that vehicle with the same guide who was very temperamental and kept threatening us. We absolutely refused to go in such a vehicle with a guide, who according to local sources suffered from some mental problem and was thrown from South Africa  four years back. He came with an accomplice called Prince the morning we were to leave for the KHWAI concession in this beaten down vehicle and both of them threatened us. We were clearly now scared for our lives as with two of these characters going on a highway was impossible. We contacted the agent who refused to take our calls anymore. The guide, Steven Bond Mubi thereby left us and our luggage on the roadside and left.

We were left with no reservation, no hotel and no transportation on the roadside in a strange country. After 6 and a half hours of waiting in the sun we finally got accommodation in Airport hotel, Maun, where we spent the next three days trying to book our return journey, shocked and disappointed. After having given this agent $40,000 we just didnt have any money to hire another agent to finish our holiday. While we waited for our tickets to be rescheduled, we met with the police, consumer affairs and Botswana embassy people, who on initial investigation found that not only had he cheated us but also pocketed our $30700 and the new amount of $8615  was all for fresh bookings. We had to let go of all ur money and the entire holiday. We had to spend an additional $1000 to change our tickets back home. We have lodged an official complaint and have a letter from the embassy of Botswana as evidence. All terms and condition, including safari vehicles pictures and what vehicle was given to us - I have all the evidence. A 400 page complaint has been sent to all concerned authorities. I just want to warn everyone that never to go with this agent or his guide. I have lost all my life savings and came back empty handed. Besides this $40,000  international tickets cost us an additional $5000 . We not only lost a lot of money but also the experience of a beautiful country. As pointed out by the police commissioner of Maun, Calvin Machekano of Love Africa Safaris along with his associates, Steven Bond Mubi & Prince did this deliberately and robbed us. We have filed an official complaint of fraud and cheating against them. Please note that we have all evidence and acceptance letter by the police and consumer affairs Botswana."
arif,US,Visited: September 2016,17-Oct-16,20-35,2-5 safaris,Msafiri Travels,2,not living upto the promise,"we booked selous game reserve 3 days tour with them .. 7 adults 4 kids ..
first thing .. leina was very quick to respond to any queiries .. she collected the payments from me from my place and was swift with responses ..
but from the start of safari the service looked glitched.. first day one vehicle arrived and we had to wait one hour for the second vehicle 
after reaching the camp we had booked 3 rooms 3rd tent wasnt ready even after 3 hours of arriving and when the tent was given it was clearly a makeshift arrangement as the camp looked overbooked.. a tent of 2 was turned into tent of 4 with extra beds cramped in it with no mosquito nets.. they gave us a better tent next day but out of 2 nights one night was wasted and our mood spoiled
on 3rd morning we didnt want a walking safari instead an extra game drive but drivers werent informed about it so we had to inform drivers on our own and then they rechecked with the company.. it was all messy
on whole 3 days or even after the safari the tour operator didnt call even once to ask how were we doing or were the arrangements fine..
on last day she called me and asked for an extra 40 usd .. she said my wife ( who is tanzanian) didnt present her ppt on the park gate so she had to pay her full fees .. i told her nobody asked me for any documents and my wife was carrying her passport with her all the time .. if asked to present the passports it was on hand .. it was a communication mistake between them and the drivers which she was trying to put on me and extract money ..
last day the drivers were told not to give us lunch .. i said the lunch is included in package .. so the drivers arranged a lunch in completely horrible place where none of us could manage to eat.. we had carried foodstuffs with us that came handy
so with msafiri travels the experience was horrible.. i wouldnt advise anyone to go with them .. i have been on safari before and some people provide much better service
on the positive side Butembo selous camp was very cosy .. it gives u a great feel of jungle .. and the walk from restaurant to tents is like walking in real jungle .. ameneties are nice .. tents are good .. exceptionally clean hygenic and in great shape .. its real luxurious..though in summers a fan would be handy in tents as it gets very hot during summers..
the staff was super polite and saw to every demands of us..
food was average .. but in a camp which has only 7 tents u cant expect a buffet .. they had limited menu in dinners but it was fine ..
the drivers peter and ramdani were fabulous .. specially peter was so fearless .. they werent at all tired of driving whole day to try and spot animals .. they really went out of the way and made this trip memorable .. were also very polite and friendly 
over all we had great time due to the camp and drivers .. hence 2 stars to msafiri for providing us this camp and drivers .. or else there isnt much about msafiri to recommend"

He cannot be trusted. Andrew did not include all activities, services, and meals as promised for the itinerary we agreed upon for the set price that was established. There were numerous activities and fees he did not book or pay in advance, causing multiple complications. He tried to cheat us out of several things to keep as much money for himself rather than honoring our agreement. He refused to give us vouchers or contact details for accommodations, drivers, or anything related to our trip after he got our money and we were already in South Africa. He put us in an unsafe and very vulnerable situation on this trip, not to mention caused us immense anxiety. We had to spend our free time trying to troubleshoot the problems he created. We lost hours battling with him trying to pay for things he promised and had to recruit people from our lodges to help us. He scheduled drivers to pick us up at our hotel at the same time we were supposed to be on a boat ride or safari 3 hours away. This caused us to miss multiple activities be they were not scheduled in a realistic way. We were left in the middle of no where without a driver one night and another night we not given the accommodation we were promised and forced to camp in a tiny zip up tent in the middle of wild animals instead of the luxury tented lodge described in the itinerary that Andrew just decided he was not going to book as promised. I could write pages on all the lies and deception this man did regarding our trip. Andrew literally told me that he was going to make my trip painful after he took our money and we were dropped off by ourselves in Kruger NP (when he was supposed to be our guide/driver for 2 more days)and this was the only thing that came out of his mouth that was true. Do not give this company or Andrew any money. Avoid at all costs."
Ashley Vera,ZA,Visited: May 2017,09-May-17,20-35,first safari,Doyen Safaris,1,"Liar, Thief, Coward and an Overall Scam!","I am absolutely disgusted with how horribly I was treated during my stay in Kenya after booking through Doyen Safaris. The owner, Kennedy, is the biggest liar, thief and coward I have ever met in my life. When we booked the trip in December, Kennedy was very responsive to my questions and concerns and gave me an itinerary with all of the hotels I would be staying in, so I felt comfortable and excited for the trip. But that was all a lie. From the moment we arrived in Kenya, there were several mix-ups and we were not delivered what we were promised. The hotels we stayed in were 3 of the most disgusting, dirty, old, and unsafe accommodations I have stayed in. The sheets we marked with blood from the mosquitoes and the beds had dirt on them. We were supposed to stay in glamorous tents when we went to Masai Mara, but I was shocked when we got there and I learned that first off I had to share a tent with a total stranger I had met in the car an hour before and second the place was a complete dump and even had a mouse in it. My group was promised a private tour but soon realized Kennedy had placed us with two other travelers. Every time we tried calling Kennedy to fix these issues he would tell our driver, Stanley, he was too busy to talk. The one great thing about the trip was our driver. Stanley was absolutely amazing and made the safari worth it, but anything else Kennedy was involved in was a complete disaster. The food was included in our package and it was the worst food I have ever eaten and I actually came home with typhoid fever because of the dire conditions of the camp. On my last night in Nairobi I was supposed to stay at the hotel Kennedy listed in my itinerary but of course when I got to Nairobi he said the plan had changed because the hotel was booked (he had already done this to us the day before with another hotel as well). I became very angry with Kennedy and began listing all the things that had gone wrong since the start of the trip and he acted like this was brand new information to him even though Stanley had been telling him all along what was going on. He denied everything and seemed shocked when I told him I had to share a tent with a stranger and he blamed the camp. He refused to take any responsibility and promised me he would put me in a 4 star hotel to make up for it. He had a driver take me to another hotel and as soon as we pulled up I knew this was not a 4 star hotel. It was a complete dump. They showed me to my room and when we walked in it turns out there was someone staying in that room already, so we went back to the lobby. I called him and told him this was not acceptable and that I had paid him a lot of money in order to stay in a nice hotel. I sent him several pictures of acceptable hotels I had found online and told him any of those would be fine. He asked me to go to booking.com and pay for the room and that he would send me money a week later through PayPal. Obviously I refused and told him he had to come to the hotel and sort it out right away. He finally came to the hotel and looked upset and annoyed and tried to convince me to stay there. I told him I would not stay there and he just sat around not saying or doing anything for about 20 minutes. Finally he got up and walked out of the hotel without saying a word. After 10 minutes I had the driver call him and he said he was figuring something out. An hour later I was still sitting in the lobby and now he was ignoring the driver's phone calls. I had the hotel call him and he told them to tell me I could either stay there or find my own place and pay for it myself. I was SO upset. What a liar, thief and a coward. Absolutely disgusted that these kinds of people actually exist. Do NOT book with this company. This man is only out for one thing. Your money. My goal is to spread this to as many people as possible so they don't have to experience what I did. "

They can customize packages for your needs.
Affordable to an extent (Don¢®?t forget to bargain though)
They also do safaris in Uganda and Tanzania

Cons:
They do not deliver what they promise. 
There is a vast disconnect between the Guide/Driver and Mr.Otieno. The guide controls what you do on your trip. We missed 3 (2 evening (1 Amboseli, 1 Mara) and 1 morning at Nakuru) game drives and one was shortened (The last morning at Mara) as the guide was in a hurry to get out of the park. We did phone and also email Mr.Otieno to get things sorted however, nothing worked. He kept on promising that all will be right and as per the promised itinerary however, the guide kept doing what he wanted. The guide/driver (Anthony) who took us around for 7 days was experienced doing the same thing for 17 years however for them, it¢®?s business. The guide started throwing tantrums as we spoke to Mr.Otieno regarding the game drives that he refused to take. 

They fail to understand the needs of customers. In my case, we were 4 wildlife enthusiasts in a single vehicle; all disappointed with the way we were treated. Kenyan wildlife was my dream come true with this trip however, the guide ruined it (He and his tantrums). 
I would still have rated them a ¢®¡Æ5¢®¡¾ if they could just stick to what was promised as per the itinerary. 

Dear Mr.Otieno, You must start understanding what people look for and deliver what you promise. This is a business for you; however, for us travelers, it¢®?s a dream to plan and execute something like this."
Astrid,UK,Visited: July 2014,16-Nov-16,65+,first safari,Tembea East Africa Safaris,2,Do not use Tembea East Africa,"Never use Tembea East Africa Safaris out if Nairobi. What should have been a once in a lifetime, carefree trip turned into a stress-filled experience as a result of the firm's poor cash management, incompetence and the deceitful customer service. In the end to continue with our trip I had to pay over $850 in additional costs to cover their admitted mistakes and they have not refunded me. From my perspective they have stolen cash. Full story below.

We recently returned from an 8 day safari tour in Kenya and Tanzania through Tembea East Africa Safaris. Throughout the planning process the owner operator Issa S was helpful and responsive. As required bY Issa we paid our deposit well in advance of our trip to secure our lodgings and park entrance reservations. Two weeks prior to our arrival we confirmed our trip and wired the final payment. Although we were met at the airport and taken to our first night's accommodations we had considerable issues with Issa as the trip progressed.

We did not have the luxury accommodation reservations in the Masai Mara park as contracted and only learned of a change while en route to an inferior substitute -AA Lodges- (our room had no hot water, the lock on door was broken, the toilet in the room didn't flush, and the pool was out of service). When I told him I was not happy with this change Issa said he would call and make reservations for us at the contracted Mara Sopa Lodge. He ultimately called and said there was nothing he could do since he called but they weren't answering their phone. Unlikely story? We ended staying two nights in the inferior lodge.

Things deteriorated further when we were at the entrance gate of Serengeti Park. Issa had failed to deposit the appropriate amount of cash required in advance and after more than 2 hours waiting at the gate for resolution, the only solution was for me to use my personal credit card and charge $400 for one days entrance. Both the guide and I reached out to Issa several times by phone but after our initial discussion where he blamed the problem on the ""banks being closed on Sunday"" and not that he failed to deposit the cash on time, he simply refused to pick up his phone. We missed our evening safari drive and arrived at our camp late, frazzled and $400 lighter. No money was available the next day in time to pay day two fees so we spent additional hours riding to various entry points (taking away from our safari time) and ultimately I had to pay an additional $400 in park fees. Issa sent an email apologizing and told me he would meet me at the Kenyan border upon our return with $800 in cash.

Things got worse upon leaving Serengeti to enter Ngorogoro Crater. He again delayed cash arrangements so we needed to wait at the entrance 2 hours until the transfer cleared. Unfortunately he didn't deposit the correct amount and because of the park payment system we could not use cash or credit card to make up the difference. As a result we waited another several hours at the entrance for the transfer. Because of this delay we were only able to spend 2 hours in the park (versus the 6 hours scheduled) and missed a good portion of our safari drive that day in the Crater. Everyone in our party was disappointed since this was a key part of our trip. Again, Issa refused to respond by email, text or phone in spite of the guide's and my attempt to reach him for some explanation. To add insult to injury we arrived at the Ngorogoro Farmhouse for our overnight and they couldn't find our reservations. They ultimately came back and said that reservations were only made that day so we were initially not on the list. Luckily they had accommodations.

We did make it to the Kenyan border the next day but Issa was not there with the money. He sent an email apologizing and said he would meet me in Nairobi at our hotel with the cash. Our last day at Amboselli went well but upon checkout there was a cash shortage and for us to leave at a reasonable time to return to Nairobi (5 hour drive) I once again had to personally charge $66. I was now owed $866.

I was obviously angry with Issa and his lack of professionalism in managing this safari trip. When we arrived at the hotel (6:30 pm) he was not there. He finally answered his phone and when I confronted him about these issues and his absence at the hotel as promised he said he would be there shortly with the cash refund and we could discuss. We waited until 8 pm and he never showed. His guide, the hotel clerk and I tried to reach him. He simply let the phone ring and then would not pick up. He eventually emailed me around 10 pm that he didn't show because I was too aggressive when I spoke to him. He guaranteed that I would be refunded the $866 by the time I returned home.

I have been home for more than a month and have received numerous emails from his finance person Damien assuring me that I will receive a refund. After reading comments on Trip Advisor (and Damien's recent silence) it is apparent that no refund is forthcoming.

I need to be fair and say that the trip was saved from total disaster because of the knowledge and professionalism of our guides, Abraham in Kenya and Dennis in Tanzania. When we were on safari rides they were excellent, answering all our questions and seemingly blessed with a sixth sense to ferret out the animals. We have no complaints on that end.

Issa is an obvious incompetent who lacks professionalism and unless I get refunded, an obvious crook as well. He never offered any sympathy, apologies and definitely compensation for the downgrade in hotel and for our time lost from our safaris because of his failure to transfer adequate funds for hotels and park fees. We planned a long time for this very costly trip and were very disappointed with our decision to go with Tembea. Do not make the same mistake.

I am glad to answer any further questions on my experience.

Attila,IE,Visited: September 2022,30-Sep-22,35-50,first safari,Glorious Tanzania Tours,2,Be careful to avoid a trip from a nightmare,"Tl DrIf you dare to book with Glory, confirm your exact itinerary, find out who delivers the services, whether she takes responsibility for anything at all from what she sells to you and then cross your fingers to not end up like me.

I was recommended Glory by the manager of the Shoki Shoki hostel in Zanzibar city as I was looking for a last minute safari. At first she had nothing available but a few days later she contacted me on WhatsApp with an offer to join two other travelers to Mikumi on a three day trip. She sent me a picture with an itinerary, the price and the starting date. 
I gladly accepted, paid on her website after checking her reviews here and looked forward to the trip to Mikumi with a visit to a Masai village teh first evening, a full day game drive the second day, a dinner show the second night and a sunrise walk up a hill the third morning with private transfers between Dar and Mikumi and meals included.
My ""guide"" Joseph met me at the ferry in Stonetown and put me into a car with two other people in Dar waving me goodbye after exchanging only a few sentences on the ferry.
I felt that this was a bit weird but went with it, thinking that the other man in the car is my new guide. 
Our driver dropped us at a bus station outside Dar. Ar this point I started asking questions and found out that we had no guide but rather Joseph gave some cash to my fellow traveler who happened to be a very nice local man to help me get to Mikumi and to cover my share of the safari car. The agent told him that another man will pick me up at the bus stop. 
This was followed by a 7 hour drive on a local public bus.
Unfortunately there was nobody at the bus stop and Joseph was not answering the calls of my fellow traveler.
At this point I contacted Glory and asked her what is happening with the visit to the Masai village, why didn't I get a private transfer and why don't I have a guide? 
She told me that she never saw the itinerary she sent me. She only forwarded that as she simply outsourced me to Joseph. She didn't organize my trip ( only took a cut) and told me that the itinerary I received was never achievable from the price I paid. At this point I was fuming.
She did not want to take responsibility as in her view Joseph was the one that owed me the services. 
Eventually she organized to pay for my park entry fee and my packed lunch but I had to pay my second night of accommodation, organize another bus ride back to Dar, sit on a crowded, uncomfortable bus for another 7 hours, get my own transfer from the station outside Dar to the ferry and pay for my meals on the 2nd and third day.
At the end I got a 4hr game drive in a car from around 1980 and spent 2 full days traveling there and back on some horrendous buses, spent the whole time worrying about how will I make my way back, spent an extra $50-100 on top of what I paid up front and got a lower back pain that took me two weeks to get rid of. 

And what was Glory's response? It wasn't her responsibility. She trusted the wrong people but that is not her fault.
What about the fact that I paid her, based on an itinerary that she never intended to fulfil? - you may ask. She thought that was not her fault either. ""I should have known that this itinerary was not achievable. ""
She reassured me that no matter how I feel about this trip God understands that she is a good person and thus all is good.  Let's just say that I didn't quite agree.

Would I recommend Glory's glorious travel agency? Not this time. Thanks.

Similarly, I would not pay a penny to Joseph's wonderful agency, Jodari Expeditions either. 

Stay away from these people if you can."

They just whatsapp you ( yet the hotels wifi was very slow so we received these messages very late) They only wait for  you 20 min and leave you . 
The second and third tour guides were really good. Congrats to them. The company only gave us activities for the first two days and left the other 4 unattended. During drop off to the airport on our departure we were left to navigate on our own until we reach our take off gate.  Generally won't go with them again. I rather book for myself amd go alone.

Ayesha,UK,Visited: April 2022,25-May-22,35-50,over 5 safaris,Classic Tours & Safaris,1,Do not use. They will scam you.,"They charged us for a private car to Moshi from Nairobi. The car broke down 1 hour into the journey then we had to get a bus the rest of the way. A 6 hour journey took us 10 hours. They refused to give any money back. We negotiated they take us back to Nairobi in a private car for ?65 extra which was agreed. The driver turned up late in a safari jeep which is meant for off roading and not to travel a long journey. This was ridiculous for a 7 hour journey. They then agreed to swap for the original car (that the GM had decided to use herself instead of giving it to us despite us paying for it) that was agreed and the GM herself turned up an hour late again and had no excuse and refused to offer any explanation. Literally when asked she said ""I have no explanation and don't want to talk about it"". Because we were so delayed, our journey ran into the evening when it was dark and we then pulled over by the police who extorted another $60 of us. During this time, the driver left us alone in the car and I am so sure he was involved in the extortion as when we were originally pulled over he said something to them and then left us alone and only got back in the car after we handed the money over. Do not use this company. They are involved in scamming. They take your money and do not deliver. Don't ruin your holiday. Absolutely awful. I will be telling local hotels not to use them too in order to save guests being ripped off and lied to. We wasted 2 whole days of our trip because of their incompetence. The drivers name was Goodenough and the lady who is the GM and an absolute joke when it comes to looking after customer safety and service, her name is Beatrice Dimitris Dallaris, General Manager of Ngurdoto Mountain Lodge and Classic Tours and Safaris and Ngurdoto Shuttle Services.

And food was bad, There were always flies around the dishes.

The guide of the lake Nakuru and Amboseli was also the worst.
He was often late ,and could not find the wild animals.
And,when he took me the next place,he dropped off many times because he wanted to buy goods.

Barbara,SE,Visited: July 2017,24-Aug-17,20-35,first safari,It Started in Africa,1,Car crush & stolen money - make sure not to book any trip with It Started in Africa!,"The safari with It Started in Africa was a series of bad adventures and lost money.
The trip started with a car crush with a fuel truck in the middle of Ngorongoro conservation area, caused by our car breaks malfunction. It was very dangerous situation, fortunately we managed to continue the trip next day in a new car (even it worse shape), without very serious injuries, but being really shaken up, in pain and with multiple bruises.
Secondly, the problems with financials appeared. Enough though we covered all the fees and permits in advance we were forced to pay again for entrances to National Parks. Not only we had to cover the expensive payments again, but also we were hold on each gate for hours, losing time planned for our safari (above on a whole day that we already lost due to the car accident). Moreover, it turned out that the company did not pay their subcontractors as well, e.g. for our car rental. Therefore, on a final day of our safari we were hunted through the Ngogoro crater by the car owner, who insisted on immediate car return. Instead of enjoying the nature we were forced to participate in multiple arguments between our driver and the car owner about the missing money. The problems continued also upon our arrival to Zanzibar where we had to repay multiple transport fees, which again we already covered by us before.
We discussed it with the ITIA office multiple times and did not receive any attention or support, at certain point the office simply stopped answering the phone or returning emails. 
We are also aware that this was not an exceptional case, as during our trip we have met several other groups, who had to repay the fees already covered and like us lost a lot of money. 
We selected ITIA as tour operator due to their highly positive reviews at TripAdvisor. Unfortunately, those turn out to be absolutely not true. Not only they stole money from us, but most importantly they did not ensure safety and support during our trip. Make sure you never book any trip with It Started in Africa office."

Bea,DE,Visited: September 2022,23-Sep-22,20-35,first safari,Capture Tanzania Adventure,1,Every day stress,"The experience is fantastic, seeing animals every day is amazing. The problem is that we never knew what was going to happen that day or the next, the guide had no information. Every morning we would leave and we didn't even know in which hotel we would sleep. Everyone in the group had different itineraries with different hotels and different activities (many of which we didn't do). We made the reservation and payment with them more than six months ago. But then we found out that nothing was paid for. Neither the hotels, nor the entrance fees to the parks. We have had to pay our entrance fee to the Serengeti park and we don't know at this point if we will get our money back, the other people in the group don't even know if they will be able to travel tomorrow (we suspect that the company Capture Tanzania has not yet bought the tickets). The whole problem seems to be one of the owners, who seems to have had an accident (of which we have three different versions) has not been able to send the money to his partner who does nothing but lie to us on the phone saying that we will get what we paid for and at the end of the day we are still staying in hotels that were not in the offer, of lower quality and every day we have done less hours of game driving. If you are thinking of doing a tour with them we recommend looking for a serious company, because so far the only thing I can say is that we feel scammed by this company."
Bea,BE,Visited: July 2016,22-Aug-16,20-35,first safari,Ewamanns Safaris,2,"Subcontracted safaris were great, transfers between them were not","We went on a 9-day safari that included Masai Mara, Lake Manyara, Seregeti, and Ngorogoro Crater. Each of the parks were very enjoyable and we saw a ton of animals, including all of the Big 5. However, all of our transfers between the parts of the safari were very stressful. 

When we flew into Nairobi, there was apparently a driver waiting to take us to our hotel, but we were not told to expect a driver nor did we see anyone at the airport that seemed to be looking for us, so we took a cab to our hotel. When we got back from the Masai Mara leg of our trip we were staying at the same hotel for a night, but the hotel had to call Erick, the safari manager, to verify that we actually had a reservation because it didn't seem to be on the books. We then had no idea when we were going to be picked up in the morning to go on the next part of the safari. It turned out Erick was coming to the hotel to talk to us later that night, but we were not told to expect that. He told us he would be picking us up in the morning to take us to our bus to Arusha, but in the morning he did not show up, so we had to call him, and then eventually someone else showed up to take us where we needed to go. Once our bus got to Arusha, there was a crowd of safari bookers and cab drivers waiting to take the bus passengers where they needed to go. All the other passengers either knew where they were going, or a safari booker came on the bus and knew the passenger's name and where they were going. We were left on the bus with no idea where we were going and no idea if anyone was supposed to be picking us up, and then we were asked for our bus ticket, which we didn't have. We luckily had Erick's phone number from calling him that morning, but our phone's didn't work in Tanzania so we had to have someone else call him. Erick told them the safari company that was supposed to be picking us up, but they didn't answer their phone when called. We almost took a cab (that we would have had to pay for) to that safari company's office, but luckily the people who were supposed to pick us up arrived right as we were leaving and caught us. We had a similar experience when arriving back in Arusha at the end of our trip, and we had to have the hotel call the Tanzanian sub-contracted safari company (which we luckily remembered the name of) to verify that we had a pre-paid room, and then again in the morning to verify they were actually coming to pick us up. When we got back to the bus, we were again asked for a bus ticket we didn't have, and we again had to have them call someone to verify that we had a prepaid bus trip back to Nairobi. 

A lot of this stress could have been avoided by giving us a detailed itinerary with all the information about the sub-contracted safaris, pick up times, and contact info for a person at each transfer. 

To top it all off, before we even left our home country, Erick contacted us to inform us of some increased park entry fees, letting us know we should bring a little extra money to cover them. We did so, but when we settled our balance on arrival, the balance did not include these increased park fees. Then, on our second night in Nairobi (between the Masai Mara and Tanzania parts of the safari), Erick gave us a long explanation about how he sets the safari prices for the whole safari season even though Tanzania often increases their fees in the middle of the season. He told us that he does not force his clients to pay the increased fees since they agreed to a lower price, but that he tells his clients about the increased fees in the hope that, if they have a good time, they choose to pay the price increase. This made it sound as though he wanted us to think of a the increased fees as a tip that he should receive if he did a good job. Because of this long-winded explanation, I chose to see how the rest of the trip went before deciding whether to pay the fees, and since we had to convince people at every leg of the trip that we were pre-paid and have them call various people to make sure, the trip didn't seem like it deserved an extra tip. However, once we arrived back in our home country, we received numerous communications from Erick asking us for the money for the park fees. All of this felt pretty slimy to say the least. The ridiculous part is, if he had just included the park fees in the balance when we settled up at the beginning of our trip, I wouldn't have thought anything of it. Instead he had to make it seem like he was demanding a large tip for a very sub-par job. "
Ben,US,Visited: February 2023,06-Mar-23,35-50,first safari,Azas Safaris,2,Disappointing,"Short story, animals were good everything else was not, I would NOT recommend Azas Safari.

Long story.
I had high (honestly too high) expectations, and this trip left me lacking in all areas.

I did a lot of research and narrowed it down to a few options. Prisca was very friendly and quick to respond via WhatsApp, she sent us a very professional quote and was willing to customize (better hotels, different activates, charge more money) our 10-day Ugandan safari. However, communication decrease as we got closer to our trip and we only stayed in 1 of 6 of the original agreed upon hotels, the other 5 hotels changed 2 or 3 times each from our agreement till on our trip. The hotel pictures in the agreement looked very nice and I googled every hotel we were supposed to stay at and was excited, but most of what we got was disappointing. The hotels are important because in general the nicer the hotel more options and better food. Almost all of your meals will be at your hotels.

Our guide Christopher had a good eye for spotting wildlife and had substantial animal knowledge, he lacked customer service skills and communication skills. He set the bar for the trip by arriving 1.5 hours late to pick us up on day one, with no fuel or drinking water in the vehicle. The vehicle was an older Toyota land cruiser. Nicer than a lot of the other vehicles we saw but not great and not the one in picture from Prisca. We got to experience 3 minor break downs and 2 very minor fender benders. We had problem with one of the front hubs, going up a hill overheated? and problems with the ignition, so we got to push start the vehicle twice. My shoulder seatbelt on the back passenger side did not work correctly, none of the gauges worked and the vehicle had no air-conditioning. 

Half the time it felt like Christopher was on a trip and we were just riding in the back seat. Should have been him taking us on our dream trip. He never asked us what we wanted to do. We had to pry the daily plan out of him.  He would stop and get a snack for himself but not offer us or information is that lunch is still 2 plus hours away and we might want to buy our own snack. Our agreement said meal plan ¢®¡ÆBreakfast, Lunch & Dinner drinking water, non-alcoholic drinks¢®¡¾. We ended up buying one of our lunches and only water in the safari vehicle was included, we had to always pay for water and soda at meals. (Honestly drinks were cheap but not what was agreed to).

My wife and I agree we would NOT go on another trip is Azas. I don¢®?t know if the other companies are better or if this is the standard of service in Uganda???

Ben,DE,Visited: August 2018,15-Aug-18,20-35,over 5 safaris,Vacay Holiday Deals,2,The tour guide didn't know where to take us and the tour was poorly organized.,"Unfortunately our expensive tour with Vacay Holiday Deals was much worse than expected.
We were told the name and telephone number of the driver that would be picking us up in our hotel in Nairobi about four days prior to arrival. The morning of the pickup, another man picked us up and said that he would be replacing him. Unfortunately he had no idea about the package we had booked. He had to look at our voucher to find out details such as the itinerary (where he should take us, where we would be staying, the fact that fees for parks etc were already included in the high price, the fact that water was included, and that drop-off would not be Nairobi but Iten near Eldoret).
The car was terrible for the Masai Mara. Every other car and especially the jeeps and Land Rovers passed us constantly. It took us much longer to reach the camp than it should have, and we couldn't take some of the roads that other visitors were taking. We had asked about the condition of the vehicle in advance, and we had the confirmation that it was suitable for a visit to the Masai Mara. This is definitely not the case. Even now in the dry season, it was almost impossible to pass some of the roads.
It seems like Vacay hires external drivers with their private cars to drive the tourists around. Both the driver and Vacay try to keep their profit as high as possible, with disregard to the experience of the customer.
The camp (Mara Concord Game Lodge) was excellent. The owner and all employees were very welcoming, and made sure we had a great stay. We had an excellent view of the river, where we could literally see hippos from our window. The food was very good too.
In our previous planning and dealing with Vacay, we had determined that all fees for the parks and conservancy and also the guide would be included in the package. Of course the voluntary tip was not included in this yet.
Nonetheless, on our first day a second man entered the car, and he was never really introduced to us. It seemed like he was supposed to be the guide, but he never said anything to us, nor was he in any way familiar with the park. He sometimes pointed our driver in a random direction, only to find out minutes later that it was a dead-end.
We came to Kenya for our honeymoon in order to see the Great Migration. Since we only took dead-ends, and then couldn't pass one of the rivers (that every Land Rover passed with ease since it was only 20 cm deep), we couldn't get to the section of the Mara River where the Great Migration of wildebeest and zebras takes place. We were told that ""there aren't really that many animals in the park anyway,"" which is hard to believe since the Masai Mara is the reason that many people visit Kenya in the first place, and it is one of the most famous national parks in all of Africa, famous for the herds of animals.
When we said that we would love to see rhinos, we were told that these don't exist in the park (other people told us they saw them, so that can't be true). When I mentioned some information on areas in the park that often have rhinos (which I read in my guide book and online), the ""guide"" and driver didn't even recognize the names of the areas of the park.
When the guide left after the second day, we were told that we had to pay a fee for his services. This was not about a tip, but an actual fee that we were meant to pay, even though this was already included in our package.
On the third day we were meant to have an early-morning game drive (which is when most of the animals are out anyway). Our driver said ""it is cancelled"", and simply started driving towards Eldoret.
On the way the car broke down, about 80 km from our destination. We were not surprised, since the terrible old car took quite a beating on the roads. We stood in the roadside in the burning sun for two hours, and then had to pay for part of a taxi ride by some private driver that our driver organized. He explained that Vacay would pay for a small part of the ride, but we had to pay for the other half to reach our destination. Considering the amount we paid for our package this is completely ridiculous.

It is really unfortunate that we made the booking with Vacay for our honeymoon. We specifically didn't go with a budget option, because we wanted to enjoy these special days."
Ben,US,Visited: January 2018,05-Apr-18,20-35,first safari,Absolute Holiday Safaris,2,Stick to Kenya and don't expect great customer service,"We had combined 10 day safari in Kenya-Tanzania. Everything was great on the Kenya side.  Driver was fine, would answer questions if you asked, but you did have to ask.  Accommodations were better than expected with private bathrooms and actual beds in tents.  They definitely work to find animals and make the most of the time in the parks.

Tanzania - nothing went right at all. We were supposed to be met by the director Abraham at the bus depot and he was not there.  So very confusing getting us to our hotel in Arusha.  

Day 2 the driver, George, brought us to Lake Manyara when our itinerary said to go to Serengeti NP. We were dropped off at camp around 430 near the lake, not in the Serengeti.  He refused to t call anyone to check on the mix up for us. Basically that it was not his problem and we were stuck. 

Day 3 We should have had a full day in Serengeti national park.  We did not arrive until 2 or 3pm. George told us breakfast was at 730 and we would leave at 8.  . We did not depart until 10am.  No one could give us an update on when we would leave. They claimed the delay was due to the chefs. Who produced fried chicken so burnt we couldn¢®?t eat it at lunch. We had our driver changed 3 times that morning. Though Etome ended up as a very good guide. The Serengeti camp ended up being far superior to where we stayed near Manyara 

Day 4 The game drive was very good this day though it was only 6 hours not the full day we paid for. We had a brunch and dinner instead of 3 meals.  No time on the trip were we given the chance to visit Olduvai gorge and the museum. Also no evening nature walk was offered at the Simba camp. 

Day 5 The game drive this morning was very good. However we did not enjoy a picnic lunch in the crater as described.  We were driven back to camp to have lunch which was not as scenic. David did meet at at the border for our transfer back to Nairobi airport and did not ask us for additional money when the police pulled over our car and asked for bribes to continue on.

However, he claimed that he would rectify the situation that had happened in Tanzania and we would hear within a week.  When we contacted him a week later he said he was still working with his Directors and Abraham in TZ.  2.5 months later and we have never heard from him again.  No refund or any other compensation for going to the wrong park and wrong lodging.  

Kenya was great but avoid working with the TZ company.  They will lie and not stick to the paid for itinerary. And once on the trip you have paid and are stuck going where they bring you.  Very disappointing that David appears to communicate greatly until they have your money then they don't care what happened to you.

Parts of the trip were disorganised, very expensive comparative with other companies, meals paid for were not made available, suppliers used by ATC were slipshod in their attention to detail and expensive.

Booking through On The Go Tours we were informed that there was no way that optional excursions could be paid for in advance, we were therefore surprised and annoyed to find that other travellers on our trip using a Dutch Agent had all major excursions included in the price.

Itineraries supplied by different agents for the tour were slightly different and this caused confusion with at least one out of the three trip leaders we had, and meant last minute changes in plan.

Changes in tour leaders, cooks and driver also..."

He knows the parks, anticipates the behavior of the animals and turned out te be a nice guy. The cook had had simple tools but presented good meals.
So far so good. Yes, we knew we booked a budget safari (four days, four persons, $600 each) so we couldn't expect to much luxury. The problems started with the jeep. Despite assurances that all our gear would fit in it, the jeep was way too small. Richard arranged al larger one at additional costs ($300). The tents we were supposed to sleep in were moldy, had zippers that couldn't be closed and leaked. The least one may expect on a tent safari in the rainy saison is that the tents are waterproof. The first night there was an alternative: simple concrete huts"

My friend Andrea and I fell for them and feel that we got scammed!
We booked a trip with them for March 2023 to do a round trip in Uganda. We decided to book it because of the attractive pricing. We checked with them whats included and they told us, that everything is already included in the price (permits, car, tourguide, accomodation, food...), so we did the initial payment. Right after that the let us know that the offer was sent by a IT guy and he forgot to put tax in the offer, but as its their fault, we don't have to pay anything extra. 
The tour started and it was good for the first few days. We even asked if we could extend the reip for 2 more days and paid 500?©¡ extra in cash for that. But right before we should go to see the gorillas Solomon (owner of the company) told us, that our vegetarian diet exceeds the budget and he has no money left to pay during the trip if we go one like this. We were stupid enough (and maybe annoyed enough) that we made a deal with him: we agreed we would pay for the accomodation and he would manage the rest so we can go on with our trip as planned. 
The next day we had a long drive and I remember waking up in the car because it stopped. The other guide (abraham) and the driver left the car and now it was only Solomon and us. We were standing at the roadside in the middle of no where and Solomon told us we need to pay 900?©¡ extra to proceed the trip, otherwise he hasn't any money left. He put such high pressure on us that we considered paying for a second. After lots of tears the trip was being canceled. And they brought us back to Kampala (btw we even had to pay for the gas). 
In Kampala we had a lot oft extra costs and we contacted Solomon to ask for a refund of at least the 500?©¡ for the extension if the trip, that obviously did not take place. We are discussing this with him since March. We didn't want to give bad reviews immediately as we were still hoping for our money.
Solomon will answer to our comments and threathens us to contact our workplace to leave bad comments about us, he threatens that he will let my friend be arrested in Kenya and he tells lies about us being racists. He even tells people that we are lesbians which is concerning due to the fact that homosexuals can go to prison for that in Uganda or even get sentenced with death penalty. He not only seem to be a scammer but threatens us as persons and considering to harm us.

Bhat,AT,Visited: August 2007,22-Aug-17,35-50,first safari,Baboon Budget Safaris,2,Disappointing - Would not recomend them to any of my friends.,"Communication- Fair
Service- was pretty  bad. they dont stick to the timings . On the day we were to leave from Nairobi to Masai Maara, we were quite appalled with the  quality and cleanliness of the mini bus that we were driving to Masai Maara. When we were told  that this would be the vehicle that we would go on the game drive , we politely refuse to take that vehicle considering the rough terrain that we would be covering as the Van was in really bad condition without propoer upholstery and bad seats.
when we insisted they  had the vehicle changed to a slightly better one.
Day 1- Evening -on reaching MM ,our Tour guide (Fred) was not able to locate our lodge amidst the Savannahs and we aimlessly wandered for about an hour searching and then he decided that we would go on the game drive after which we will find the lodge.
Day-2   was the best day of the 3 day tour as we were on the game drive from morning to evening.  Packed lunch was provided.
Day-3 our schedule was to leave for another game drive from 630 to 830 am after which we were to drive back to Nairobi. However when the tour guide came to pick us up he said that there was some technical snag and the car battery was having problems. We hardly took off and the van stopped twice in the grasslands. We then suggested that he go to the mechanics available in the town to which he agreed and after a 40 mt drive we reached the place but none of them were available. it was already 820 by then and he quitely filled petrol and said that he suggests that we skip the drive as we would reach Niarobi only between 7pm-9m if we went for the drive.   We agreed to that as we were a bit concerned about the Vehicle giving way in the middle of the Savannahs with animals around us.
Little did we know that this was a ploy by the tour operators as half way through on our way back to Nairobi , the guide stopped for lunch and after lunch he  told us that there would be a change in plan and that  we had to move into another car which was parked beside ours and that the passengers in that car would travel in the vehicle we came from MM and we would go to nairobi in their car.
at that point of time we actually wondered how could they take them on a game drive if the van had technical snags (stoppped at least 3 times in Masai Maara when we started the game drive)??
It was just a pretext used by these guys as they needed the car by noon to make the swap.

Overall - Althoguh i would want to visit MM again , i would not take another package with them as their service was quite disappointing  and would not recomend them to any of my friends.

Birch,US,Visited: November 2016,09-Feb-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,Bushmemories Safaris,1,Can't be trusted. Kenneth Karuhanga is a fraud.,"Four months ago we reached out to Ken for a proposal to organize our trip to Tanzania. He is based in Uganda but is also listed as leading tours in Tanzania on your website, and his proposed itinerary and reviews made him seem like a good fit. He said he would be the guide for both our six-day ascent of Kilimanjaro and our five-day safari from Moshi. He asked for a $1000 deposit to cover national park fees and staffing costs, which seemed fair. 

One week before the trip Ken told us he needed more money since it was the holiday season and costs were higher. We felt it was unfair to change the budget right before we started traveling, but agreed to move forward with the trip as planned and to pay the extra sum when we arrived.

When we arrived in Moshi and expected to meet Ken, we instead met a woman named Neema Mushi who runs an agency called Licious Travel Adventures (also on your site). She explained that Ken was not coming to Tanzania at all, that her price of the trip was under budget and that Ken had not forwarded any of the deposit money we had sent him. 

We spent many evenings frantically trying to reach Ken and recover the deposit money to run our trip as planned, but Ken said he had needed the money for ""another project"" and couldn't send it right now. He finally sent $175 to Neema, but that didn't cover half of the new price increases she insisted on. 

Possibly worst of all we learned that Ken had been pushing Neema lower and lower on her price, while asking us for more and more money. When we asked him what he felt he did to deserve the $825 cut he took for himself, he said something about booking the one hotel we stayed in during our trip.

Our experience with Ken was one of: 1) misleading us to believe that he would be leading the trip; 2) never once mentioning he was reselling our trip to an extreme budget agency; 3) lies about early cost increases of the trip and sticking us with the bill of the actual increases; 4) theft of our deposit money (he still refuses to return it)"
BJ,CA,Visited: July 2018,14-Oct-18,65+,over 5 safaris,Avian Watch Uganda,2,"Mixed up itinerary, below average guide, unreliable vehicle, unkept promises","We booked a private 20-day birding tour from July 25-August 13. The main guide, Alfred, was already booked so we had a guide who doesn't guide as often and wasn't as experienced. Main problems1) we had a final itinerary from the office, but it turned out that the guide and driver were given a different version of the itinerary, leading to unexpected and unpleasant surprises during the tour; 2) one of these unpleasant surprises was being told the morning we were supposed to do a chimpanzee trek later that day that we had not paid for the chimp permits and therefore would not be doing the trek. We had copies of the final invoice that clearly stated the price included the chimp permits, but the guide said he was told we could not do the chimp trek; 3) the guide tried to tell us we were wrong -- even when we showed him the invoice; 4) later, we managed to speak on the phone with the office representative and were assured we would be refunded the US$300 for the chimp permits that we had paid for. This was confirmed again by email after we returned home. To this day, more than 2 months after the end of the tour, we still have not received the refund despite several reminders to Alfred. 5) The vehicle we were in during the tour broke down at least twice, leading to long delays to try and repair it. The only good thing about the tour was the driver, Benson, who tried his best, given the situation. He often performed tasks that the guide would normally do such as making sure we were taken care of on the gorilla trek. The guide, on the other hand, paid no attention to whether things were okay with us, be it accommodations, meals, or on the trails. He never once asked how things were going for us. He was more interested in chatting with local guides and park rangers than in finding the birds and helping us to see them. Sadly, we cannot recommend this company as our experience was way below an acceptable standard."
Blair,US,Visited: September 2018,10-Oct-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Gombe Track Safaris & Tours,2,Got me to Gombe but didn't deliver all of what was promised,"Gombe Stream NP is an amazing, magical place. The chimpanzee treks themselves are conducted by TANAPA (Tanzania's national park service) regardless of how you get to Gombe. The TANAPA guide assigned to me was superb. 

Gombe Track provided a driver in Kigoma and a cook who accompanied me to Gombe. Both were great and individually deserve 5 stars. The driver stopped by on my night in Kigoma to point out the MV Liemba coming into port, and the cook took time in the evenings in Gombe to help me learn Swahili.

Unfortunately, my overall experience with Gombe Track as a tour operator was marred by two issues.

First, the itinerary I agreed to stated all meals and non-alcoholic refreshments were included. This turned out not to be the case. I was forced to pay for a number of waters and sodas, and on my last day in Kigoma, was told by the ""hotel"" (see below) that my meals were not included. As a result, I opted to skip two meals (dinner and breakfast) rather than pay for food that should have been covered.

Second, the itinerary I agreed to called for one night in Kigoma at a specific hotel (Coast View). I researched this property beforehand to ensure it was acceptable to me. Instead, without any notice or discussion, I was taken to another accommodation which seemed to be of much lower quality (Aqua Lodge).

Unlike Coast View, Aqua Lodge had no internet/WiFi, no restaurant/bar, etc. While the staff seemed friendly enough and there was a great lake view, my room had only a squeaky ceiling fan that didn't cool the room very well and the poor ventilation allowed outside cigarette smoke in. The bed had a thin bed sheet over over a mattress that wasn't even tucked in. There was a leak in the bathroom that left the base of the toilet in a puddle of water. Finally, I could hear just about everything in the one nearby room that was occupied by a couple who decided to get frisky at 3 am. Needless to say, I didn't sleep much and was counting down the hours until I left.

I should note that my trip to Gombe was initially arranged through another tour operator, who I had a great experience with on another safari. After I had agreed to terms and was in Tanzania, I was handed off to Gombe Track directly. The full payment for my trip was given to Gombe Track. As far as I am concerned, it was Gombe Track's responsibility to be aware of the itinerary/terms and ensure they were followed since it was the company actually conducting the tour.

I paid Gombe Track $900 for 4 days and the last ~22 hours were in Kigoma where I was basically on my own waiting to fly back to Dar es Salaam. This amount did not include the TANAPA fees (park entrance, guide, accommodations at the park, etc.) and airfare, which added more than $600 to the total cost.

$900 should have been way more than enough to profitably cover my (limited) ground transportation in Kigoma, the boat to and from Gombe, 4 days of meals and non-alcoholic beverages, admission to the Livingstone monument in Ujiji, and one night of accommodation in the Kigoma hotel specified in the itinerary I agreed to.

While Gombe Track got me to Gombe and back, and I appreciate that, I now know I paid a lot more than necessary and despite this, I still got less than what was agreed to.

I had been in contact with the owner of Gombe Track via WhatsApp prior to my trip and never heard from him after the trip to see how it went, which was disappointing, especially given the cost. I did two other safaris while on Tanzania, both of which were much less expensive on a per day basis, and both operators were eager to collect feedback afterwards."

So the day starts when they pick us up in our hotel and then take us to the place where we should take the boat. There was zero communication, the driver of the car just told us: go there and you will find someone else, without any ticket or anything. We got in a random boat following instructions of someone we had no clue who he was. After a while in the boat they explained us the programme of the day that didn¢®?t match at all with what they had promissed us the day before in the office. Then after a while in the boat the engine fell off the boat to the water what ended up ruining it as it didn¢®?t work again. Minutes after this happened, a horrible storm started so we were in the middle of the sea, under a storm and with no engine. In this situation the staff of the boat didn¢®?t informed us at all about what was going to happen or what they were planning to do to fix the problem. We were all wet and cold by the rain (including children in the boat) people started to get scared by the situation and then they found out they did not have life jackets for all of us. Many passengers of the boat asked the staff to call the police or the rescue services, however they were not listening and even they seemed to not have a clue about what they were doing or they could do to solve it. After an hour and a half under the rain a small boat arrived and managed to take us to the shore. Still with what had just happened the staff of the boat was trying to push us to still go for the lunch as planned (just to avoid people asking for a refund of the money) and then try to go for a swim eventhough it was raining. Of course we did not agree on this and we just went back to The office of this company to ask for a refund of the money as we not only didn¢®?t do any activity but also had been in a dangerous and stresfull situation in this boat with 0 safety measures. For our surprise on arrival to the office and after explaining everything they refused to refund us as they claimed ¢®¡Æit is not our protocol). We decided to call the person in charge to talk directly and instead of a helpful answer this man decided to start shouting at me on the phone. After a lot of discussion and a formal complaint we decided to leave our bank account details as they guarantee us that they would refund our money after few days following their protocol. As it was to be expected from this shameless people, it has already been a week and not only we didn¢®?t recieve the money back but also they are not responding to our emails or calla.

There experience was much better- and cleaner.  For the price you pay, you'd think it would be a stunning room.  It is not. The locals I know in Cape Town informed me what it actually costs a local to do this for them.  They tourist price us of course and 
I'd be fine if I had a beautiful room with an amazing bed and stunning accommodations.   This was 2 dirty not even the size of single bed beds, no frame to them, no skirt on the bottom box spring showing it for all it's dirtiness, a dirty shower, dirty walls, old dirty looking towels (they were clean but the vibe felt gross), everything felt dirty.  I paid almost $800 for those two nights & not really 3 days.  I thought that would mean a beautiful sleep in beauty.  We all chatted over dinner on the condition of what we got and felt the same.  My recommendation- book a stunning hotel separately.  Book the safari's separately.  it'll be the same or cheaper.  And you can self drive as well but you'll miss out on the amazing information the guides give.

However, I'm rating them a 2 because if you sign up with Big Time, you should understand what you may be getting into. They are slightly dishonest, and they consistently try to get more money from you.

It started by us agreeing to a 9 day safari online in advance of our trip. When we got to the Big Time office, we paid, but they made us pay an extra 5% to use credit card... And they do not accept checks. So they immediately violated the contract we agreed on, but after arguing, there was nothing we could do, because our whole trip depended on this safari, and we had no backup plan. So we paid extra.

Then, we learned that our 9 day safari was actually 2 smaller safaris with travel days in between. And despite the contract saying ""all meals and hotels/campsites are included in the 9 day... "
Brian,BE,Visited: September 2021,28-Sep-21,35-50,2-5 safaris,Achieve Global Safaris Ltd,1,Plagued by admin issues.,"My experience with Achieve global safaris wasn't great. After some back and forths with the team an itinerary was agreed on and 50% was paid in advance, it was mentioned that the remaining 50% would be paid on arrival with my Amex.
Here's a summary of the issues I faced:
I was told my Amex would work, it didn't, I had to dig around for another card
During the Rwanda part, of the trip, the driver saw and commented on my headphones, upon returning from the chimp safari he told me he used them and they were great. Not cool. He'd also eaten my lunch so I ended up with his choices. Again not cool.
For the Congo part, I needed my yellow card to show my vaccines, I wasn't informed about this but took it anyway. Feedback from admin was 'oh we thought you knew'.
For the flight from Rwanda to Uganda, I was not informed beforehand that I needed a visa. I escalated that to the admin contact and again she said 'it's not our fault, we thought you knew'. A shocking response, they informed me about the Congo visa but not the Uganda one? Madness
The Uganda itinerary wasn't accurate, there was confusion between admin and the driver, luckily I hadn't booked the hotel myself or else i'd have lost money.
The Uganda seemed to be more concerned with working on his preference of timing. I missed an activity because he didn't want to eat at a certain time, which meant us waiting around for 2 hours in the roasting heat doing nothing. 
The Uganda driver asked if it was OK to pick up his wife on the way back from Queen Elizabeth park to Kampala. I said OK but this actually added 2 hours to the trip that he didn't tell me about.
Overall it was pretty disappointing. I also voiced my concern that there were no internal flight options proposed, the admin contact came back saying 'I didn't know your budget'. Another odd response considering 3 hotel budget options were proposed.

Avoid, the whole experience was pretty disappointing."
Brian K,CH,Visited: June 2015,30-Jun-15,20-35,2-5 safaris,East African Safari & Touring Company,1,Nightmare Safari with EASTCO,"Our trip with EASTCO is one that we will struggle to look back on with anything other than frustration. We were stuck with a guide who was rude, unprofessional, unsafe, had terrible communication and clearly cared nothing for us. And we were stuck with a company operating broken down vehicles, run down camps, and that clearly cared nothing for us. We found ourselves counting down the days until we could go home, and by the end of the trip, going along with ridiculous outings and schedules simply because it felt like the path of least resistance and our only survival mechanism.

Our troubles with EASTCO started before we even got out of Arusha when our guide, Melk, arrived 45 minutes later than our agreed upon time from the evening before and then spend an additional 20 minutes preparing the car while we waited. Then before we left the city, the engine started over heating causing him to pull over suddenly. After looking at the engine for a bit, Melk said that it would take an hour to fix. Assuming this was a low estimate ? in fact he didn¢®?t get to the crater until the next day ? I said that this was not acceptable. Without saying a word to us that he was leaving, Melk then hopped on a motorcycle and road off leaving us in the truck surrounded by several guys that we hadn¢®?t met. He came back after a few minutes and another truck arrived to take us to our hotel. It wasn¢®?t the hotel listed on our itinerary, but it was nice so we didn¢®?t say anything. The replacement driver suddenly stated that he was leaving as the hotel staff was greeting us. We tried to stop him to get more information on what was happening but all we could get out of him was that Melk had fixed the truck, was on the way, and would be here shortly. That turned out to be a lie since if Melk was on the road at that point he would have made it to the gate well before it closed at 6 pm. The replacement driver then quickly jumped in his truck and left before we could get his, Melk¢®?s, or EASTCO¢®?s contact info. We then enlisted the help of several of the staff at the hotel over the course of the evening and the next morning trying to contact EASTCO. The emergency contact number we were given didn¢®?t answer. EASTCO¢®?s number is not posted on their website. The hotel staff talked to folks at the hotel¢®?s central office to try to find out who made the booking. Working with them before and after dinner and despite the hotel¢®?s best efforts we got nowhere that night. The next morning we still had nothing and it was starting to eat into our time in the crater. Exploring Ngorongoro Crater has been a dream of mine for most of my life. I can see it from the hotel but I don¢®?t have a way to get down there. Do we try to hire another company? Are there any guides that can take us into the crater at short notice? Suddenly Melk shows up and says ? and this is an exact quote ? ¢®¡ÆReady to go?¢®¡¾ ¢®¡ÆThat¢®?s all you have to say?¢®¡¾ ¢®¡ÆThe truck broke down. This happens.¢®¡¾ ¢®¡ÆYou couldn¢®?t call the hotel?¢®¡¾ ¢®¡ÆI didn¢®?t have the hotel¢®?s number.¢®¡¾ This was an unprofessional and rude response, to say the least. This is a good time to point out that Melk would make 30 ? 40 calls during a day of driving. He often claimed they were to the EASTCO office. Here¢®?s five seconds of my time on the Internet hitting the front page of the hotel¢®?s website. Their number is(+255) 272545555. It is ironic that Melk continually took credit for being the car¢®?s mechanic, and yet complained that it was not his fault when the car broke down.

After 30 minutes or so of awkward silence in the car Melk pulled over to offer a half-hearted apology which he followed with a rebuttal of my complaint that we paid a lot of money for the safari and we deserved to be treated better. Melk said that we may have paid a lot to EASTCO but we didn¢®?t pay him a lot so it wasn¢®?t relevant to him. He also offered that if he was unhappy then he would just follow exactly what¢®?s on the itinerary and we wouldn¢®?t see much game ? basically what he did our second day in the crater. 

It was clear that Melk had no ability to empathize with us ? particularly when it came to us feeling safe. On our way out of Arusha he talked about how safe the city was and that anyone could walk alone any time of day ? certainly not matching any other source of information we had heard. He would regularly pull over in villages without explaining, hop out of the car, and walk away with the keys in the ignition. On the way from the crater to Serengeti Horizons he pulled over and we were surrounded by several guys. One of them then jumped in the car with us. My wife asked ¢®¡ÆWhat¢®?s going on?!¢®¡¾ I said I had no idea. Melk then gave us a detailed explanation of the situation¢®¡ÆWe give him ride.¢®¡¾ At which point, we proceeded to drive into the desert, off the roads, and away from civilization. With a guide who clearly hated us, a complete stranger, no way of contacting the outside world, and no explanation or even a mention of ¢®¡Æthe camp is this way.¢®¡¾ My wife has stated that she has never felt so unsafe in her life. 

The accommodations at Serengeti Horizons did nothing to make us feel better. Our itinerary stated ¢®¡Æsemi-luxury¢®¡¾ and EASTCO¢®?s description of Serengeti Horizons included ¢®¡Æfull-size stylish wrought-iron or wooden beds with six-inch mattresses and all bedding¢®¡¾. In reality the mattress didn¢®?t even cover the bed frame with the foot of the bed using a rolled pillow and cut up foam to form the mattress. The sheets had holes in them to match the level of quality. EASTCO¢®?s tent ¢®¡Æfrom the golden age of safaris¢®¡¾ included a light plugged into a car battery ? but no trash can so we pilled the trash in the corner of the tent. I was a bit nervous leaving our bags unprotected as we went off on safari so I made sure I left the zippers in exactly the same place for all bags so I would know if they were touched. When we came back one of the bags had been moved and the zippers were all the way to the other side of the bag. We couldn¢®?t find anything missing so I didn¢®?t bring it up, but what possible excuse could there be for this?

Our itinerary states that ¢®¡Æthe ecosystem is defined by the annual migration¢®¡¾. The migration was farther north than expected and Melk was apparently not going to take us to it or even bring it up. As he started to drive around the mostly barren plains the first morning at Serengeti Horizons we asked what the plan was. He detailed the day¢®?s activities with ¢®¡ÆWe do game drive.¢®¡¾ No information was going to come from him but thankfully another couple at the camp had found out that the migration was in the central Serengeti. When we said we wanted to go there to see the migration Melk said nothing in return. Was he just ignoring us? Unbeknown to us one of his next phone calls was to the head office and they said it was ok but we had to pay the $131 entrance fee to the park. We agreed given that it would be our only chance to see the migration. At the gate we ran into one of the couples from the camp the previous night. They were more successful in their complaints. EASTCO had moved them north to another camp closer to the migration and was paying the park fee. There was no such deal for us though. Inside the park Melk started driving slowly and staring at trees along the main road near the entrance. When we asked he explained that he was looking for cats. If a leopard was in one of those trees right next to this busy road it would be surrounded by cars. When we complained that we wanted to see the migration instead - which is why we paid the park fee ? he got mad. After finding the migration we stopped at a picnic site for lunch. When we got out of the car he drove off without explanation. We really weren¢®?t sure if he was coming back.

At Serengeti Horizons we spoke with other EASTCO victims and heard stories about how their vehicles broke down and how one couple had to push their vehicle each time to get it started. We then heard complaints about the lack of radios in cars both for security and game viewing. Our second time into Ngorongoro Crater we were focused on getting a good look at a rhino. Cars started flying by us and Melk went off on one of his lectures about the evils of radio calls. We finally got a view of what everyone was headed toward and it was a rhino. We went over and got an ok view of it though it was slowly headed away. With a radio call we might have gotten a better view. Melk said that just one EASTCO car has a radio and that¢®?s for security reasons. If we breakdown outside of cellphone coverage how does another EASTCO vehicle having a radio help us?

Our second day in the crater didn¢®?t hold much interest for Melk. He drove past the hippo pool lunch spot and when we started getting hungry he sped past most of the second half of the crater. The lunch spot was in the forest near the exit. He parked us under a tree with the roof open. A monkey came down trying to get our food and I asked if we should close the roof. Melk explained ¢®¡ÆNo¢®¡¾. The monkey jumped in the car a few minutes later and my wife and I jumped out with Melk chuckling. The monkey stole some of our lunch and Melk wanted us to get back in the car to finish the rest. I said ¢®¡ÆNo¢®¡¾ and Melk finally moved the car away from the tree. Melk was already on the phone again when my wife asked me what I wanted to do. I said ¢®¡ÆI just want this week to be over.¢®¡¾ I¢®?m not sure if Melk heard but when he got off the phone he left the vehicle to pout for a while. We ended up buying our own replacement lunch back at the hotel. Melk certainly wasn¢®?t going to. He drove us the last bit of forest and then turned around to leave. I believe he put lunch near the end of the loop so he could hurry getting us to lunch and then claim that he ¢®¡Æalready drove all the roads¢®¡¾. My wife ? who had continuously gone out of her way to be outrageously nice to him ? said that we wanted to spend a bit more time in the forest. Melk replied with an ugly ¢®¡ÆDo you see any other roads in the forest?¢®¡¾ When we agreed to leave after a bit Melk committed what I believe was his worst act of the week. He punched the gas with us standing in the back and wildly drove up the switchbacks no doubt angry at us. My wife sat down first and I was trying to catch a few last pictures of the crater. She had to warn me that a big turn was coming and I barely sat down in time. Melk whipped around the corner and I¢®?m sure I would have been injured without her warning.

EASTCO held other nasty surprises for us to finish out the trip. In Mosquito Town our tour included being dropped in a tourist trap where we were asked to look around because we were their first customers in 4 weeks! We then went to Boundary Hill where we were taken on a nature walk. I managed to get all the way up Kilimanjaro and back without falling but I fell on their trail ? as did my wife. She was uninjured but I was dealing with a shoulder injury for the next month. The last part of the climb involved 30 minutes of climbing back up the hill while walking through thick vegetation. The binder in the hotel room states that you shouldn¢®?t walk through plants because they contain ticks and dangerous snakes. Something we seriously doubted our ¢®¡Æguides¢®¡¾ could protect us against at the pace they were moving. They apparently take every guest on this hike but they can¢®?t cut a path or find one that doesn¢®?t involve being in almost continuous contact with one bush or another."
Brittany,KE,Visited: June 2019,17-Jul-19,20-35,over 5 safaris,Natural World Kenya Safaris,2,A HUGE disappointment. Don't waste your money on this tour!,"While looking in to this tour I was excited about the advertised ""We shall be on the lookout for the endangered Sable Antelope, Elephants, Giraffe, maybe Leopard, civet cat, monkeys, shrews.""Unfortunately this was far from reality of the situation. After further talk with locals we realized that there have not really been animals in the park for over 5 years or more. I felt like I was taken advantage of with this ""tour"" for $300 USD for two people. 

The planned itinerary""At the Shimba Hills National Reserve proceed for a morning game viewing drive. We shall be on the lookout for the endangered Sable Antelope, Elephants, Giraffe, maybe Leopard, civet cat, monkeys, shrews. For the bird watchers, more that 100 bird species have been recorded including Ostrich, Eagle, African Hawk and Honey Guide. We shall further explore the Shimba hills on foot where accompanied by our guide, we shall walk on the Shedrick Falls on a 1/2 hour hike as we marvel at the water cascade. We shall later stop for lunch at the Shimba lodge where we may have an option to take a nature walk around the tree lodge or simply enjoy the surrounding views from the balconies of the lodge."" 

What actually happened
We were picked up on time by our kind guide Ali. He was very nice and did a wonderful job all day. He was basically the highlight of this poor tour. The morning game drive was very telling of the lack of animals present in Shimba Hills. Once entering the park we drove for about an hour to the walking destination and literally saw only warthogs. No monkeys, antelope, or even birds really. Our driver pulled over because he thought he saw a chameleon, thats how desperate he was to find animals for us to see. This was the first sign that the day was not going to go as planned. 

Once we arrived to the walking destination, we were talked to by the Park Rangers and informed that this was was very strenuous walk and be prepared to be walking for about 2 hours (not 1/2 hour as advertised). The walk was beautiful and scenic of trees and water, but of no animals. Also, as a tour company, you should be more upfront with your customers of the type of walk that is going to happen. There were so many stairs and even walking on small slippery stones up a hill at one point. While this was fine for my husband and I, we had no idea that this was the type of activity that we should have expected, not to mention the vast difference in walking time. 

Then on to the lunch destination. Another huge red flag in the state of Shimba Hills. Once arriving to Shimba Lodge we were met with no electricity in the ENTIRE lodge. While this was not a huge deal, when it came time to pay it was. My husband had to walk out of the lodge and hope to get service to pay the pill. The only person working at the Lodge was our waiter and he had informed us that there were no other guests at the Lodge at all. There were no other people in the restaurant either. It was literally silent. It was honestly creepy, and not the place I'd like to have lunch on a tour. The food was deceit, but not great. 

We decided to cut our ""tour"" short after lunch. It made more sense to us to go enjoy the beach that drive around in an EMPTY park for another few hours. I was honestly so incredibly disappointed in this ""safari."" I feel as though I was scammed. We were promised a lot in the description of the tour and the experience fell very short. There were no animals. Literally we saw more monkeys and birds outside the park than in. I feel you as a company should EXTREMELY revise the description of this tour as well as the price. I was lead to believe by your website and Lilian that this tour would be something very different that what it actually is. 

As someone that has been to many safaris/tours in Kenya, this was by far the WORSE experience. Sadly because of this experience I will not be using this tour company again as well as warning my friends. What a waste of $300 USD as well as a full day of my vacation. "

Bruno,US,Visited: December 2018,16-Jan-19,50-65,over 5 safaris,Yala Safaris Uganda,2,Old decrepit vehicles and poor communication,"I booked a 14-day safari with Yala ? this was to cover safaris in both Uganda and Rwanda ? the booking process went well and Yala was initially good in communicating promptly. When I arrived in Entebbe, they were a bit surprised as they had not seen the arrival announcement ? the van that was to transport me to the hotel was an old decrepit van without an A/C (I should have seen this as a sign to come) ? in any case I made it to the hotel and was told that the safari vehicle was to be another one in much better condition.
The next day, the driver showed up in another old decrepit vehicle and lo and behold, the A/C was not working in this one either (Note ? most of the roads in Uganda are dirt roads so you need to keep the windows closed and wear dust masks). The driver did not speak much English, even though what was promised was an English-speaking tour guide. We decided to push on ? about a couple of hours into the journey, the right rear tire developed a side bulge (this was a re-treaded tire that had developed a sidewall failure ? re-treads are banned in the USA for just this reason). The jack that was in the vehicle did not work, so we had to limp back to town to get a shop to help us ? this took about 3 hours in all. I contacted Yala and insisted they provide me with a better vehicle and they promised to do so. When we reached Murchison Falls, we were covered with red dust due to having to keep the windows open as the A/C did not work. All of my game drives were in this broken-down van which had a low clearance resulting in us scraping the bottom every time we went through a ditch.
Two days later, Yala had still not provided a replacement van, but they did change the driver to one who spoke better English ? we made it back to the main town again on dirt roads with no A/C. I had asked for the replacement van to meet us there so we could continue on our journey ? guess what ? no van. We ended up leaving the decrepit van at the hotel and continued to our next stop (chimp trekking) in a small Toyota Corolla. Two days later, a replacement van showed up ? guess what the windshield had a big crack in it along with pockmarked glass ? it was an old van but the A/C worked. So, we continued onwards and got stuck on a mud-soaked road (the van did not have off-terrain tires and did not have a high clearance) ? the villagers helped us and we resumed our sight-seeing when suddenly the engine stopped and would not start. After waiting for 2 hours for a local mechanic to show up, he discovered that is was a GPRS failure as the van was not permitted to go out of a certain area ? the mechanic by-passed the GPRS device and we were able to start the engine and go on our way to the next stop. By this time, I had sent Yala about 6 emails none of which were replied to. 
The next day, while climbing up a mountain road, the gear shuddered and then gave way with a loud bang ? again we were stuck on a mountain dirt road for 2 hours before getting a ride to the gorilla lodge. Yala switched the gorilla lodge without my consent because it was closer to where the gear breakdown happened and did not return any of my emails on the subject.
Two days later, a different vehicle was provided ? this time an SUV (which is what was agree to when I first accepted their contract), and an A/C that worked. I was told that we had to exchange this vehicle back for the one which had broken down in a couple of days when returning from Rwanda. Two days later on returning from Rwanda, we were to meet at a designated spot to exchange vehicles as the van had been repaired with a new transmission and drive shaft ? at the last moment, we were told to continue onwards in the same SUV as before. Yala again changed the safari lodge I was to be staying at without informing me (this after confirming that all the lodges had been booked and that I could not change any dates given all of the issues I was having) ? again no replies to any of my emails other than talking to the driver.
I finally made it back to Entebbe ? no word from Yala, no apologies for all of the issues, no explanation for the 2 lodge changes (and both were terrible when compared to the original places) ? nothing. Be careful when booking with this agency ? they have terrible vehicles and very poor communication. I would not book with Yala again -the only reason for the 2 stars is because of the efforts of the drivers who were with me ? they tried to do their best with little or no support from Yala

Bruno,ID,Visited: August 2023,08-Nov-23,50-65,first safari,Bluerange Connect,1,"Avoid this agent, a real shame !","We booked a trip for 4 people for August 2023 ? Kenya Tanzania with this agency Bleu Ranger Safari Kenya for 11 days in the largest parks (7 in total), a still substantial budget. But it seems that this agency does not provide quality at all - the guides are drivers who barely speak English, have no knowledge, and do not even have the program in hand to follow it at least the vehicles are in poor condition, and the assistance when things start to go wrong, completely non-existent¢®? We had to complain constantly to finally get a response from their office¢®?¢®?.
The accommodations were 80% modified each evening and without any information even before arrival... it's pure amateurism for a trip that was supposed to be superb...
The impression we have is that they cut back on all the services from the start, driver as cheap as possible (he was not aware of the program, did not speak English at all, a real disaster) ? the poorly maintained, dirty and uncomfortable vehicles ? meals on the side of the road in dens where the menu must cost 1USD/person no more ? hotels not at all up to standard and constantly dislodged from start to finish. We got so fed up that we cut it short and asked to send us back to Nairobi earlier at our expense at a last hotel (Radisson Blue) for the exceptional cost which saved us the end of the trip... With the last driver who almost came to blows with us because of the lack of tip..

This agency has completely put us off Africa... we are disappointed by this experience - don't trust it, because they are not professionals at all, just offering the worst services to improve their margins, to the detriment of the client! !!! Scandal !"
Bryce,US,Visited: June 2015,10-Jul-15,20-35,2-5 safaris,Amazing Tanzania Tours & Travel,1,Not Value for Money,"I honestly can't recommend this tour agency, or any of the other budget travel companies that do similar trips. A good budget operator is meant to cut the frills and provide cheap food and accommodation, but these guys (and all the others) are cutting the quality of the animal viewing experience in order to try and offer the cheapest trip. THIS ISN'T VALUE FOR MONEY

Firstly, the itinerary. All their budget itineraries only spend one or two nights at Seronera (Serengeti). This isn't enough time if you want to see the Wildebeest migration. The first full day in Seronera is always spent looking for cats, so you need a second day to drive out to visit the wildebeest herds, wherever they might be. They could be as far as the Grumeti River, which you can do as a long day. Don't bother asking the office about whether you will see the migration. I asked specifically if we would go to the grumeti river and Godfrey answered ""You go to where the animals are"". Well when I was on the trip, the animals were at the Grumeti River and it was never a part of the itinerary. I was lied to.

Also, Lake Manyara is entirely skippable. The itinerary only includes it because it's a super cheap day for the company. Save your money and skip this day, and pay for an extra day in Serengeti. Much better value.

Secondly, starting time. We left Arusha on our first day at 9am, arriving at Tarangire after 12pm. We started our second day to lake manyara at 8am and our thirday day to serengeti at 10am. On the fourth day there was a customer mutiny when our driver, Adam, suggested we start again at 8am. We demanded we start earlier and thankfully he agreed. This is the time we saw a large pride of lions. Many of the drivers are lazy and will try to start as late as they can get away with. The best viewing times are just after dawn, early in the morning.

Thirdly, communication. I noticed that many of the other drivers were constantly on their radios, getting tips from other drivers about the location of animals. I asked Adam why he never used the radio, he said it wasn't used much (a lie) and that he had a mobile phone for that purpose. Adam certainly made lots of phone calls but i doubt many (if any) of them were for finding game. He seemed to be on the phone a lot planning his next client trips.

Lastly, and most importantly, the agents and drivers will tell you all sorts of lies to try to convince you that you're getting the best possible experience even while they're doing the bare minimum. I asked Adam if we could spend our single full day in Serengeti driving out to the Grumeti River to see the Wildebeest. Adam could have told me the truth that this was a budget trip and that we didn't have the money for fuel, but instead he told me all sorts of lies. First that it was too far away, that you needed to go out there and spend the night, that you needed a plane to fly there, and lastly that there was no animals out there this time of year. These were all blatant lies. I spoke to other groups in the camp who had spent a day trip driving to Grumeti from Seronera and had seen the Wildebeest and river crossings. To rub salt in the wound, Adam tried to convince me that the resident herd of Wildebeest that we saw Ngorongoro Crater was ""part of the migration"". He clearly thinks his clients are stupid.

Adam really shouldn't be working with clients at all, not only does he lie about everything (he told us everyone had to leave Ngorongoro by 12pm, he just wanted to leave early), but he also gets very aggressive and argumentative with clients who try to question him about the itinerary. Once we realised we were getting a bad deal we all started to check and double check everything. He full on yelled at us bringing one lady to tears. It's never acceptable to speak to a client like this, even worse when everything you're telling them is a complete lie.

Adam should be avoided at all Costs, and this companies itineraries should be avoided to. My advice is to spend a bit of extra money and go with the mid range companies. Or if you really need to save money, form a group yourself and then go to a budget company with your own itinerary and be very clear with them about your expectations.

Caleb,CA,Visited: August 2018,12-Sep-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Meru Slopes Tours & Safaris,2,"Parks and wildlife were great, tour operator was not","I booked a 6D/5N with Meru Slopes, reading great reviews on SafariBookings.com.

I was dismayed to find out that they had shuffled me into a different company's safari, for unknown reason. This group was called Arunga Expeditions. 

The guide spoke maybe 100 words the entire safari, we had battery issues with the LandCruiser, the lunch boxes were awful (dry muffin + banana + FOUR pieces of plain bread + juice box), and we were always rushed. When we would stop at say a large pride of lions and want to spend 5-10 minutes, the guide would try and start driving away after 1 minute to find something else. We'd have to ask him to stop so we can stay and watch the lion and actually take photos. He was never happy with this and often very rude. Often we'd leave something like this after 2 minutes and not see anything as spectacular the rest of the day. He'd mutter something like ""many more lions later"". The itinerary was to have FULL safari days at certain spots (Lake Manyara, Ngorongoro, Serengeti) but this only meant 4 - 5 hours to the guide. He would sleep in, start slow, and end early, so he could take off from the campsite and go drink a couple beers and watch football somewhere. We were always the last vehicle out in the morning and first ones back. The itinerary had a full day booked at Ngorongoro but we were finished BEFORE lunch time. How does this work?

Canadian,CA,Visited: July 2019,02-Aug-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Namibia,2,low budget,"First I want to say that our transfer driver, John, was great, as were our cook, David, and our driver, Marvin. This review should not reflect poorly on them in any way, as my complaints are out of their hands. Understanding and respecting that unforeseen circumstances do occur, the condition of our safari truck was ridiculous. The sides never stayed velcroed closed and we would have to stop and fix them continuously, and the bars they were wrapped around were rusty. One hour into our very first game drive the truck broke down. We were then sent separately and alone back to camp, with unknown tourists who stopped alongside us. Apparently the fuse box was broken.  One of the other tourists in our group complained about the missed game drive and another company and driver, Oscar, came to our rescue and gave us our game drive.  The next morning we needed to push start the truck and found out the starter was now broken. We again drove with another company and Oscar, thankfully!  Aside from the inferior vehicle problems, I was so tired of eating porridge and beans that I will never consume them again! Out tour was only 3 days long and yet we ate the same thing over and over again. When I asked if we were having eggs I was informed no, because they hadn't been delivered. Oh great, more porridge! My idea of the ""delicious brunch"" that is advertised in my itinerary was not simply the bread, yogurt and Corn Flakes cereal, which was what was offered.  I wondered if all of the African tours were like this, but after joining our Nomad tour and being given fresh fruit, juices, chicken, spaghetti, and a wide range of deliciously cooked foods I have concluded Wild Cherry Tours is an inferior company and we greatly overpaid for what we received. I am greatly disappointed but at least the wildlife we saw left us with some wonderful memories of Etosha camping."

We were sold a package promising accommodation at Azure Mara Haven or comparable. What we got was Jambo Mara Safari Lodge - no WiFi, no pool, no spa, currently under construction and it books at about half the price of Azure. When I voiced my dissatisfaction, I was told that no bookings were available at the former, which a quick Internet search proved to be false. Owner George Oketch reimbursed me less than half of the difference between the room prices, which recovered one star. The other star is for his driver, Martin, who did a great job navigating the Mara and showed himself a kind and generous man with the Maasai who live there.
I learned a lot in this process. I should have stuck to my guns in holding back 10% until the end of the tour (he insisted on full payment in advance...before notifying me of the change in lodging). I should have read more reviews and done a FakeSpot review (using the TripAdvisor reviews they received a ""D"", https://www.fakespot.com/trip-business/right-choice-tours-safaris).

Apparently East African Safari & Touring Company does not have the TALA licence anymore and are almost bankrupt (at least this is what our guide told us). The safari was overall disappointing, e.g., we left Arusha very late on the 1st day (11am) and therefore we stayed less than 3 hours in Ngorongoro. We had to pay ourselves for the private campsite in Serengeti, despite was included in the agreed programme (we were later refunded once back in Arusha by the owner of the company employing the driver and owning the car), and this took a lot of time, long discussions with the driver and the parking rangers, two visits to the park HQ, etc."

Carol,US,Visited: August 2019,28-Aug-19,50-65,over 5 safaris,Land and Lake Safaris,2,What a disappointment!!!!,"I booked through African Budget Safari and they contracted with Land and Lakes Safaris  ( L&L) in Malawi. I had a good experience with African Budget Safari. I would use them again in a heartbeat. But I would never use Land  and Lakes again.
We had one major issue occurred 3 days into our 7 day tour. We are seasoned travelers having visited over 140 countries and we often travel up to 4 months a year. The major issue we encountered was unique  but strange things happen while traveling. We had driven from Malawi to Zambia and arrived at Thornicroft Lodge ( which is wonderful). After checking emails we received 2 of significance. One from African Budget Safari saying that our tour might get screwed up because of civil unrest and demonstrations which were expected to block flights out of Malawi the following week including the day of our departure. An email from the US State Department strongly suggested not flying in or out that week.  This major event was beyond anyone¢®?s control, which we understand, but what we don¢®?t understand is why Land and Lakes did nothing to assist us in making alternative arrangements.

I asked our guide, Eric, to check into the situation at dinner that night. He was  already aware of the situation but seemed nonplussed. I asked him to follow up with the L&L home office and get back to me after our game drive the next morning. 
I also sent the email from the state department  to the (L&L) home office saying we may need to change our itinerary to fly out of Lusaka, Zambia instead of Llongwe 4 days later ( airport closures were suppose to start the day before our departure). We were flying on to Uganda so we could not afford to be delayed 3 extra days. 

When we got back from the game drive the next morning our guide had no suggestions for what to do, no alternatives, and the home office  took until 12:30 to speak to me and say basically ¢®¡Æ we know this is serious but you are on your own. You either follow the itinerary and see what happens or you lose what you have already paid plus all costs and inconveniences and changes in hotels, flights and transportation are your responsibility. File with your insurance.¢®¡¾
This was not about insurance! This was about being in a remote place with very spotty internet, trying to book lodges, book a new flight, change an existing flight and arrange transportation! Thank goodness for Thornicroft Lodge ( Nadia and Dylan). They could not accommodate us but they called another lodge and got us a room. They loaned me their phone to call South African Air.  They helped me book a flight from the local airport to Lusaka. Are you getting the picture? They did everything over 5 hours that Land and Lakes,which had better phones and constant internet at the home office, should have done. We understand it was our financial responsibility and we will deal with the insurance when we get home but where was Land and Lakes,  our tour company? 

Why no suggestion such as stay one more night nearby and your guide will drive you to Lusaka and see sights along the way? It is no further than Lake Malawi. Or suggest another itinerary of sights within Zambia?  Again Thornicroft got info on driving to Lusaka $80 US pp versus flying $300pp so all the options were provided by them and not Land and Lakes.

Our guide was not allowed to accompany us into the game park and he had meals with us but otherwise was unoccupied.  After we reworked our schedule, he informed us he was going back to LLongwe.

I asked our guide what would have happen if we had followed the original itinerary and the airports did shut down - would his company have left us to our own devices? His answer was of course not. So why did they leave us to our own devices in a remote location ? Malawi has been experiencing turmoil since the election in May and I believe any responsible tour company would have an emergency plan in place to  assist when problem occurs. If not, they have the resources and should have offered to rework our schedule, at our cost, and see us safely on out way,

As I am writing this it is still a day away from the planned demonstrations and for Malawi¢®?s sake I hope they do not happen. But whatever occurs, safety is first and and L & L let us down on that  
front.

We were passed by  every other vehicle ( the other safari vehicles¢®?s suspension could handle the washboard roads just fine ) so it took many extra hours to get anywhere. Our driver/ guide was switched at the last minute and Baraka ( the driver ) spoke very little English so he could not or would not explain anything. The driver did not know where our permanent camp in the Serengeti was and he had  no map or directions. We got lost and the radio did not work properly and he had no cell service. Then the land cruiser broke  down after 8 hours traveling (transmission). He did not have a proper tool kit. Some other vehicles helped us and took us to camp 2 hours late. He fixed the vehicle that night but 2 days later it broke down 4 times( fuel leak) and we run out of gas! Another safari operator took us to our lodge an hour away.
Two days out of six on safari were lost to extra long driving days ( car could not go as fast as the others )coupled with getting lost and the multiple breakdowns

I was able to communicate with the office through Whatsapp but Buhambo, the owner/manager (?) just kept saying he was sorry or he was working on the problems. Since our diver did not speak english( though they assured us he did) we had to ask others to help us but he could not explain the animals or birds or the vehicle breakdowns and timing of travel. We had been  on safari in other countries for weeks so we knew quite a bit but what a disappointment. 

We kept asking for a new vehicle but apparently they  were all out on safari and this was rented but how would we have been able to prevent this? I booked this safari 8 months in advance and the original company I booked through was appalled but what can you do when you are in country? 


The camps and lodges were very good and Tanzania is a beautiful country. Just do not travel with BMS Safaris! We have traveled to over 145 countries and this was our worst experience by far."
Caroline,FR,Visited: October 2022,25-Oct-22,20-35,first safari,Northern Circuit Adventure,1,Bad experience in October 2022,"We booked a week's safari with this agency. The stay included 4 parks. The director of the agency, Michael, announced a small change to us when we arrived. We did not understand at the time that he removed the Ngorongoro crater from the programa must in Tanzania! In order to go there we had to pay for the park ourselves. So we paid for this park when booking with the agency and once there (we are talking about more than $430).

I would add that when we arrived, no driver came to pick us up. The agency was unreachable for an hour ¢®? I strongly advise against booking such a beautiful and expensive trip with this agency.

Nous avons r?serv? une semaine de safari avec cette agence. Le s?jour comprenait 4 parcs. Le directeur de l¢®?agence, Michael, nous a annonc? un petit changement lors de notre arriv?e.

Cath,UK,Visited: March 2016,26-Mar-16,35-50,over 5 safaris,It Started in Africa,2,Disappointing ! Even more after It Started in Africa offered to pay me to remove my reviews.,"My husband and I selected It Started in Africa as our tour organizer for a 6 day Mount Kilimanjaro hike mainly because  of their outstanding reviews and classification on Safaribookings and TripAdvisor. We also chose them because they were very reactive and had a nice website. But our main selection criteria was their ranking on Safaribookings (number 1) and on Trip Advisor (number 10).
 
The hike itself was satisfyingthe guides, cooks and porters were friendly and helpful, BUT our overall experience turned out not to be as good as expected, and there were a lot of ¢®¡Æsmall¢®¡¾ details that added together gave us the overall unpleasant feeling that we had somehow been ¢®¡Æcheated¢®¡¾ by It Started in Africa. 

The main issues were:
 
1.	No one was there to meet us when we arrived at Kilimanjaro airport. Sylvia, our tour manager, arrived approximately one hour after our flight had landed and explained that she thought we were arriving on the KLM flight and that she had not been made aware that we were on the Kenya Airways flight. My husband had send Joao all of our flight details, which he had acknowledged receipt of. And even if what Sylvia was telling us was true, she was still 30 minutes late for the KLM flight.      

2. The hotel in Arusha (Raha Leo) which was sold to us as part of the package, and included in our contract, was changed at the last minute without us being informed or forewarned. When I checked the rating on Trip Advisor, I realized that the hotel that It Started in Africa put us in (The Torch) had a much lower rating than the hotel that had been sold to us. When reading other traveler reviews posted after our trip (and since then disappeared from Trip Advisor), I realized that we were not the only customers surprised in this way¢®?..
 
3. As part of the contract, It Started in Africa was supposed to supply us with duvet liners and pillows ? we never saw them. The mess tent was tiny and could barely hold our party of 7.
 
4. My husband was victim of food poisoning and he was so sick that he had to turn back and be evacuated from the mountain. The doctor that we saw when we returned to Joburg confirmed that his disease had nothing to do with altitude sickness but was solely due to food poisoning (most likely the chicken we were served during 3 consecutive days by the It Started in Africa cook). The evacuation until the park gate was organized diligently and professionally by Tanzanian Parks. But once at the gate, the car that It Started in Africa car had sent from Arusha was not there. It was actually our piece of luck, because the It Started in Africa representative in Moshi came to pick us up in order not to keep us waiting and he agreed with us that my husband was in no condition to withstand the 3 hour drive to Arusha. The guides and I had told Sylvia, our tour manager, a number of times over the phone that it made no sense to drive back to Arusha that day, and had requested to stop in Moshi for the night, but she had refused to listen, saying that ¢®¡Æshe had already booked a room at The Torch in Arusha¢®¡¾. The hotel in Moshi was much nicer than the Torch and we were able to get a good night¢®?s rest. 

5. From the beginning of the trip, until the very last day, we were under constant pressure from the chief guides (and from the tour manager on the first day), to leave generous tips to the guides and porters. This gave us the unpleasant feeling that the porters, guides, cooks, etc are so poorly paid by It Started in Africa, that they rely on customers¢®? tips to keep their staff happy. The documents sent to us before the trip gave clear guidelines about the tipping amounts to be given out and we all know how to read ? so why be so insistent during the entire trip? It really made us feel as if we were a bunch of dishonest people who would walk away from our responsibilities, and impacted our relationship with the guides and porters.
 
6. The number of porters/guides/cooks, etc accompanying us during the trip was never clearly stated to us before the trip. We found out on the first day of the hike that 31 people would be accompanying our group of 7 people. I¢®?m not against employing a large number of people, but I believe that It Started in Africa should have been transparent about this before we signed the contract ? as this has an impact on the total amount of the trip (tips are substantial).
 
7.  When we were done with the trip, we were put under a lot of pressure by Sylvia, our tour manager to write good reviews on the spot for them, with them looking over our shoulders. I refused to do it and said I would do it later, as I don¢®?t like being pressured in such a way.

8. Our last night in Arusha was part of the package, and had been paid for and booked through It Started in Africa. When Sylvia told us we would be staying at the Torch again, we refused. Not the rat hole again! Especially considering how weak my husband was. She then suggested Kia Lodge by the airport and warned us that it would be more expensive. We were prepared to pay whatever additional cost there was to pay, as long as the hotel was decent, with water and air conditioning in the rooms. And we also asked if it would be possible for the three guys in our party who were flying out later that day to use our rooms to take a shower. Sylvia promised it all, dropped us off at the hotel reception, and then vanished (very quietly for once). Once she was gone, the hotel manager told us that it would not be possible for our 3 friends to shower (but they were welcome to drink at the bar and eat at the restaurant), and we found that there was no water pressure in our room, making it impossible to shower. And at bedtime, when we turned the air-con on, we found out that it did not work either¢®?.. The next morning, there was literally no water at all in the shower! 183 USD for a room with no water and no air-con (supposedly the It Started In Africa special rate, but when I double checked on Trip Advisor, I found the rooms to be sold at 177 USD)¢®?.quite pricy, don¢®?t you think?

But here comes the worst part!
When we returned home, I posted a review on Trip Advisor and rated It Started in Africa as ""average"", considering the problems that we had and the un-kept promises. The next day, Joao, the Happiness Manager, sent me an email with explanations about what happened and offered to pay me 700 USD if I removed my post or upgraded it to Very Good. When I refused, he offered me 1000 USD. After he had my review forcibly removed from Trip Advisor, I posted another review explaining how he tried to bribe me, and I received a 3rd email offering me 2500 USD if I removed my second review. I also noticed that the other average reviews which had been posted on Trip Advisor at around the same time as mine had disappeared. I managed to contact another reviewer who confirmed that he was offered money to remove or upgrade his review.
I then realized why It Started in Africa only had very good and excellent reviews on the internet. It seems that they bribe unhappy customers to remove or change their reviews if they are not 4 or 5 stars. And I cannot help but wonder....how many people were paid in the past? And how many people, like me, selected It Started In Africa mainly because of their track record of excellent and very good reviews and were hugely disappointed? How much money is Joao going to offer me this time, to remove my review from Safaribookings.com? I systematically read travelers' internet reviews before I choose a hotel or a tour organizer. I also believe that it is of utmost importance that travelers who post reviews on these websites do it honestly, as others rely on them to make decisions and chose their tour operator, hotels, restaurants, etc. I could have accepted Joao¢®?s 1000 USD and left it at that, letting other travelers believe that It Started in Africa provides top class service and that they are the best. Maybe they are great for a large number of travelers. But not for me, and I believe that it is unfair to other travelers to keep quiet about what is going on. It Started in Africa¢®?s business practices are unfair and detrimental to all of the tourism industry professionals who work hard and with integrity to please their customers. It Started in Africa need to understand that you cannot hide your flaws forever by bribing customers, and that there are still some people out there who cannot be bought, no matter how much money you offer them. It Started in Africa's cheating attempts turned out to be the most disturbing part of this trip for me. Knowing after hand that others before me may have had a disappointing experience with It Started in Africa, but were paid to remove their reviews, gives me the very unpleasant impression that we were cheated voluntarily by It Started in Africa from the very start.
For this very reason, I would definitely not recommend this Tour operator!

When we saw the 4X4 car picked us up from the airport in Dar, we already said it started badly. It was an old 4X4, 18 years old, in poor condition, with smooth tires! Of course we had a puncture. In addition to the nine days, he broke down twice and stopped two days.
The organization safari was bad, with trip totally undervalued times (4 hour trip turned into an exhausting 11-hour trip!)
The guides were friendly and reservations had been made and paid.
Finally, we cut and preferred to fly at our expense, to go from Ruaha park to our hotel on the Indian Ocean."

Cem,UK,Visited: September 2016,26-Sep-16,35-50,first safari,Visit Mount Kenya Tours,1,Disaster !,"We went to Amboseli and Masai Mara between 11-18 Septembre with Visit Mount Kenya Tours.
This was a terrible experience especially in Masai Mara as
- The company's minivan broke down on the first day as it was a very old and neglected car. They took us to Safari with a normal car where naturally it was impossible to enjoy savannah . The next day we refused to be in that car and we discussed with the driver and hardly found a land cruiser
- The driver (he told his name is Justus) never came to hotel to pick us up at agreed hours for the morning and afternoon safaris , he was always late 1-2 hours. The hotel management told us later that he was drunk on the first day he took us to the hotel
- Although we bought the tour by agreeing that we will stay in Sopa Lodges, the driver in Masai Mara tried to  place us in a different hotel saying that Sopa Lodges is full , we discussed with him, He talked on the phone with company owner/manager Rufus  then they accepted to take us to Sopa Lodge which was already what we agreed upon. If we did not object hardly, we would miss the opportunity of staying in a really very good hotel ( Sopa Lodge). The driver told us he would place us in a sister hotel !!?? of Sopa Lodge
- The last day in Masai Mara, the driver did not show up at all, we stayed in the hotel, we missed 2 safaris
- The last day when we were leaving the hotel, the hotel did not let us leave because Rufus (owner/manager of visit mount kenya) did not pay to hotel the money we had paid him a couple of weeks before our visit. so we argued with hotel management and they accepted that it was a problem between them and visit mount Kenya , and we left with another car hotel management found for us. We did not return to Nairobi with that driver of visit mount Kenya. 
I wont write everything we experienced but my recommendation is that never use this agency!!  We will make our officials complaints too."
Chanelle,ZA,Visited: February 2020,25-Feb-20,50-65,over 5 safaris,Adventure My Take,1,Dishonest and unprofessional,"Firstly it is important to understand that Adventure My Take is not a tour operator, but a travel agent. No matter how much the owner of the company, Tamara, will try and convince you that they use their own vehicles and drivers/guides, this is not true. They have only 3 employees, of which one is a driver/guide and who make take guests on tour during the high season. They also handle airport transfers and city tours in-house, but otherwise they will pass you on to whichever company can squeeze you into their van. The other guests¢®? tour might look very different from yours, but at no point will you be able to get this information from the company, no matter how many times you ask. 

But let me start at the beginning. I chose to book my 3-day Maasai Mara tour with this company, as they were very responsive and offered different options regarding accommodation. I did not want to stay in the most basic option, so paid extra to stay in a lodge rather than a tent.

I also arranged all my transfers through Adventure My Take, as it made sense to work with a single service provider while in Kenya. The confusion around my transfers as well as the lack of professionally by the owner raised some red flags long before I went on tour, but as I had already paid a deposit, there was nothing I could do but hope for the best. I had to keep reconfirming my arrival times, the owner of the company was late on both occasions that she transferred me to the airport, she drove erratically and played loud music and generally would not answer my questions about the Maasai Mara trip.

On the departure day I was not driven to their office to complete the payment as per the itinerary, but straight to the departure point, where Tamara proceeded to tell me that I needed to pay additional ¢®¡Æservice fees¢®¡¾. As this had not been communicated to me at any point during our many emails and discussions, I refused. It was an extremely uncomfortable start to the trip.

After a long day of driving to the Maasai Mara, the other passengers were dropped off at their accommodation. I was however told that my accommodation was another 80 km away! If you have ever been to this region, you will know how long it takes to drive just a few kilometers on the very bad roads and it was inconceivable that I would have to spend another couple of hours getting to my accommodation and then drive back those couple of hours in the early morning to be at the gate for the 6am game drive. I¢®?m sure the hope had been that I would be so tired that I would just agree to stay in the cheaper accommodation, but I refused. The driver was kind enough to contact his boss, who arranged for me to stay at a camp nearby. The quality of the accommodation was still not what I had paid for and the food was not good, but the staff were incredibly kind and did their best to make my stay pleasant.

Although I have nothing but praise for Edgar and Jonathan who work for this company, I would strongly advise against booking a tour with Adventure My Take. Tamara will promise the earth, but she is not in a position to deliver on those promises. She is unprofessional and dishonest and does not care what happens to you once she has your money. Avoid Adventure My Take!"
Charles,ES,Visited: August 2018,27-Sep-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,African Comfort Zone (ACZ safaris) LTD,2,ACZ tried to change agreed conditions several times,"After agreeing on conditions and contracting tour for Amboseli 3 days in lodges, and paying in advance 50%, they contacted to say that it wasn't a lodge but a luxury tent and that a suplement was needed for a lodge. We refused and referred to agreed terms, finally they admitted it would be lodge without suplement.
One or two days before the tour, they called us to let us know that they had problems with the vans, and that they were changing our open-roofed van for a jeep... we refused, and finally got the van as agreed (which is more spacious and permits a full experience).
During the tour, they disturbed us during dinner and argued that they had problems again with vans and proposed to change the safari drive of next day for a visit to a Masaai village. Again we had to refuse, really upset of being bothered by their logistic problems that we are not responsible of.
Last day in the return trip which had lunch included, the driver stopped and told us that the company had given him some money for us to buy food. The amount was ridiculous, so we had to refuse again and as in other tours asked to go to a proper place where the meals are arranged for tourists and we don't need to care about prices.
None of these things happened with other safari tours that we contracted.

Not directly related to ACZ, but to the AA Lodge, we found several cockroaches in the lodge, not only in the bathroom but also inside the sheets. We had to move to a tent that night.

Apart from all of that, we enjoyed Amboseli a lot, and the driver was really nice (in these tours, drivers generally do the hard work in an excellent way and get the less of the money; managers just arrange conditions and pickup the money).

Charles,UK,Visited: February 2017,11-Feb-17,35-50,first safari,Drive Tanzania Ltd,1,"Professional scam artist, avoid Yoeni Japeth Mbonea at all costs. No stars!","My wife and I engaged Drive Tanzania for a 21 day safari covering Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania to celebrate our 10 year anniversary. With the benefit of hindsight, we should have not gone ahead with this when Yoeni, the director of Drive Tanzania was either very hard to connect with or he would hang the phone up on you mid conversation, as what occurred in the lead up to us engaging Drive Tanzania. There was a lot of miscommunication due to poor communication by Drive Tanzania around flights and commitments. I thought it is just a bad phone connection but really, that has nothing to do with it. All of these tour operators have multiple phone numbers and whatsapp. Tourists do not get the number they use most for all their communications with locals and to do their business.

Regardless, we commenced our tour. Things continued to go badly. In Uganda, when we arrived, our tour guide was more than an hour late, which is quite scary late at night in a foreign country with taxi drivers yelling at you at airports. There is a minimal standard of care and for a safari of this price, it was not being met. Eventually our driver came. We found out he didn't know who Yoeni was as all of the Uganda tour was outsourced and not provided by Drive Tanzania.

That said, Uganda is amazing. Seeing mountain gorillas in the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest and getting so close to them is a life long memory. Further, the Maasai Mara in Kenya (our second country, guided by another outsourced tour guide) was also excellent. Seeing lions, cheetahs, leopards, elephants, hippos etc in the dry season was actually very worth while as we could get close to the animals as there are less tourists around.

Here is where the disaster with the fraudster Yoeni and Drive Tanzania really began. As we crossed into the border from Kenya to Tanzania our Kenyan tour guide told us he was unable to reach Yoeni and left us there, to drive back to Nairobi. I was able to contact Yoeni and he said the car had broken down and they were several hours away. We waited for them in a roadside hotel at the border as we had next to no money, afterall on safari all expenses are paid and in advance. Also, this is Africa¢®? do you think they accept credit cards or know what an ATM is? The hours passed. We got worried and tried calling Yoeni...repeatedly¢®? 110 times! He had turned his phone off. We got worried and started scrambling. Eventually we found out the name of our hotel in Tanzania in the Serengeti and when we called, we discovered there was no booking for us and we could not get into the Park. 

Yoeni Japeth Mbonea and Drive Tanzania left us stranded and took $10,000s from us. We are still chasing him for an equitable refund for more than half of an unfulfilled trip. Be careful, he has done this before. He has many different tourism companies that have come and gone. He also has interests in mining companies and gem traders. His fees are also very expensive, particularly as he outsources everything, but really he makes money by scamming foreign tourists and making a couple of phone calls to other tourist providers. His company is actually really small and he uses the money he steals from others to support an affluent lifestyle in Norway. Avoid this person [remember his address in case he starts a new company!] for your own piece of mind. Use safaribookings.com to find another tour guide as there are 2000 more out there and you will save yourself from this horrible, potentially life threatening experience.

Chirag & Hemal,US,Visited: July 2019,27-Jul-19,35-50,over 5 safaris,Gorilla Trek Africa,1,Horrible,"We had been wanting to go to Rwanda to see the gorillas for a few years. We chose Rwanda over Uganda due to the conservation efforts of the country.  A trip like this costs a lot of money so we had to really plan it out. We have traveled all over the world and have been to Africa many times including Tanzania, Egypt, South Africa, Kenya and Botswana.  In March 2019, from online research my husband, Chirag Amin, contacted the company, Gorilla Trek Africa, working with their senior consultant Nelson.  Chirag asked them to create a luxury package as we were travelling without our children after many years.  
There were some things my husband wanted to do such as go to Congo while we were there. He threw out some ideas but wasn¢®?t really guided one way or another to say whether some of those things are plausible. Eventually we had an itinerary.  So comes July and we are ready to go, we confirmed multiple times that this was a luxury package as we were paying luxury package price.   We packed everything on the list that was provided by the agency.  We flew from Tampa to DC to Brussels to Kigali. Before we had even landed and started our trip we got an email from Nelson saying 
We previously told you that the balance can only be paid in in cash in
> 
> new USD bills or by card/ bank not later than a week to the start of
> the
> tour. It is very disappointing to hear that you want to pay by card at
> 
> this late hour.
We weren¢®?t sure why he was disappointed, I guess they want cash but we wanted to pay by card. It wasn¢®?t even the cash/card issue it was the tone the email took as soon as he learned we were paying by card and we hadn¢®?t even landed yet.  I told my husband this does not sound good, so we managed to half the balance in cash and the other half by card not to make HIS disappointment worse.  
Night 2, we got to our first hotel which wasn¢®?t bad but were told by multiple people it is a 3 star even for Rwanda.  We figured we will address it later, let¢®?s see how things go.  The food was to be included in the package so we went for lunch. The menu was extensive and looked pretty good. I asked for a salad, they didn¢®?t have lettuce. Fine, I asked for a sandwich, they didn¢®?t have cheese. Fine, how about some pizza? Again no cheese. That narrowed the choices to soup and meat and rice. This wasn¢®?t an issue as it was one of our first meals. However, by meal 3 we had eaten the same thing 3 times.  The shower was slimy but the bed was comfortable.  

Our second day we went to go see chimpanzees before we were to leave for Goma/Congo.  On our tour we met many people and told them about our plans and where we were staying in Goma.  One of the gentle man was from Germany living in Kigali, a journalist that has traveled all over that area.  Him and his companion as well as our driver advised us the hotel in Goma is maybe a 2 star.  Our friend on the tour said you won¢®?t be able to stay there, its barely $40 a night.  Chirag contacted Nelson and expressed his concern, Nelson said he can change the hotel as there are other options but it will cost us 300$ USD to change it. First, a hotel that was 40$ a night was booked for a luxury package while another option was available and then we were charged $300 to change it!! Nelson¢®?s email even said the hotel in Goma is just OK.  We also expressed out concerns about the hotel we were currently staying at. In response, Nelson said our expectations and African reality were no matched. He further went on to say 

Once you lower your expectations, you will have a great trip experience 
just like what others always get

I see you are just being so picky and complicated and this will 
compromise your trip experience. 
We asked for a luxury package, paid for a luxury package to not only receive sub par accommodations but unprofessional, rude and unacceptable customer service.  We were asked to LOWER our expectations.  This made Chirag upset as believe me we paid a lot of money for this trip.  He told Nelson that this was upsetting in return Nelson said 

We are all human!

Just the way you get pissed off, i as well can get pissed off!

Let us not make an issue out of this

We need to cooperate if we are to have a good trip, otherwise threats 
won't make any good for any of us

You either enjoy your trip or ruin it, the ball is entirely in your 
hands

So my over all review, if you want to pay luxury prices, then receive sub par accommodations and even worse treatment, book with this agency.  We encountered many tourists that were staying at nice hotels so it has nothing to do with the African reality.  This agency hopes that you are a na?ve traveler and won¢®?t know any better so they can charge for a luxury package but then treat you like crap once they get your money.  Why book a hotel that $40 a night 2 stars and they say oh there is a better option, it will cost you $300 to change it.  Why was booked to begin with? Chirag never gave Nelson a ceiling for the price of the package so he charged A LOT but delivered nothing and then HE was disappointed when we didn¢®?t¢®? bring cash.  The email excerpts are just the tip of the iceberg. He never apologized and even stopped contacting us to fix anything.  And if you say anything they will get pissed off and cut off contact.  This is highly unprofessional, so forget about the money, book with this agency if you want to be treated badly.

We stayed at Treetops (highly recommend a stay here), Samburu Lodge (again a great hotel), and our driver/guide Solomon was good, he was a little maverick, and at times I wasn¢®?t too sure if he was totally sure where he was going or whether we were lost.

The second half of the week though was horrendous, stressful and has really tainted my view of the honeymoon. We arrived after an 8hour drive from Samburu to Lake Nakuru (although Cate told us it was a morning drive, and we would be there by lunchtime ? we left at 8am and arrived gone 4pm!). Our driver struggled to find the hotel (Eagle Palace), which was in the city centre, not a hotel you would expect on a safari. Once we checked in, the driver said we should go for a drive around Lake Nakuru, but Cate hadn¢®?t sent all of the money, and so we would need to pay $200USD. With the park only open for another hour, we decided it wasn¢®?t worth it, but we were now worried that our driver didn¢®?t have any money for fuel, and wasn¢®?t prepared to drive us to Maasai Mara until he was paid. Cate didn¢®?t pick up anyone¢®?s calls, said she was having bank issues, and couldn¢®?t pay until the morning. She didn¢®?t read the WhatsApp messages and we had a strife night in Nakuru.

Cate paid the driver his fuel money so we left Nakuru, and headed for the Maasai Mara. En route we switched vehicles and drivers, and it appeared that Cate had booked us onto a tour with another company (Bencia tours ? who were amazing!), we checked into the lodge (Ol Moran) and went for a drive the next day. When we arrived back at the lodge the staff were waiting for us and said our agent hadn¢®?t paid for the room and so we were unable to get into our room until we paid $360USD. They had tried to get hold of Cate all day and she had promised to pay, but didn¢®?t. After over 2 hours we managed to scramble together all the money the lodge required and paid it over, only then did Cate pay the lodge and our money was returned later that night. The lodge had told us that Cate had booked us into the lodge on the day we arrived, despite us booking with Cate 9 months before we arrived, and she had confirmed the lodge name and booking with us.
Overall the Safari was great, but African breeze were a nightmare. The company address is a PO box at JIKA airport ? and this should be a warning sign to anyone.

AVOID AFRICAN BREEZE TOURS AT ALL COSTS, if you already have booked with them, I suggest you double check that all the accommodation has been booked and paid for before you leave, and that the driver has all the money and park fees before you leave for Safari.

Chris,CA,Visited: January 2018,07-Mar-18,50-65,2-5 safaris,Karanga Adventure Tours & Safaris,2,Be Careful with this tour operator,"First of all Tanzania is a wonderful country, the people are great, and the animals are amazing.  

About the tour operator.  It appears that the owner Alpha made this great website offering tours but that's about as far as it goes.  Alpha lives in Australia, not Tanzania, and wasn't there for the tour...

The motorcycles are old Honda 250's, the bike I was given was a 1991, twenty seven (27) years old.  No horn, no speedo, but to Honda's credit the bike ran fine with only one break down in 7 days.  When you're riding a motorcycle you need a horn, its dangerous not to have one.  I complained, they fixed it but it stopped working a day later.  The other bikes didn't appear to have horns either...

When we arrived Alpha was not there. We were met by his ""associate"" who picked us up at the airport and then dropped us off at the hotel saying  someone would meet us there in the morning.  The next morning we met Kalifa and David.  There wasn't really any instruction or pre trip discussions about roads, hazards, hand signals, what to be careful of etc just hop on an go (David the lead rider, didn't speak english).  

In retrospect the disaster that happened on the second day might have been avoided if the operators had talked a bit about the trip prior to setting off.  

What happened is one of our party drove over a small road bump, wasn't paying attention and crashed at a low speed.  He fell on his ankle and broke it, a freak accident but it ruined his trip.  I know it was his fault but I think the operators should have emphasized to watch out for these sort of things.  At least two other times we came over a rises in the road to find that the road was washed out. Numerous times there could have been horrible crashes.   There was no warning from the lead rider David...

On that note, If you get hurt in this country you have a real problem.  Seeing what happened to my friend with a broken leg opened our eyes to the level of medical attention in this area.  In this area the hospitals are basically just clinics with limited resources.  

If you are seriously hurt they have to get you on a plane to fly you out.  Getting that plane can take hours...  If you suffer an internal injury you could die waiting for medical attention.  Subsequently you'd think that the operators would display a high level of safety... nope.  If you take this tour make sure you bring pain pills in case you are hurt otherwise you will suffer as there is no pharmacy close by.  (Tanzania for the most part is a third world county).

Having ridden motorcycles and dirt bikes (I'm 60 years old) for many years my understanding is the tour operator riding out front ( the lead rider) is responsible for leading the way and pointing out hazards to the clients.  There was none of this.  

Also the front rider tour operator constantly placed himself in front of me so that I was constantly covered with his dust.  I complained twice but he just keep riding there, when I tried to pass he just accelerated.  Finally I got him to back off and stop spraying me with his dust but I ended up with an eye and nose infection from the constant dust at the end of the trip.

We had 7 days riding and then got into a truck for a safari through the Serengeti.  When we got to the park gates, the guy driving the truck (who had been subcontracted from Alpha) didn't have the money for the entrance fee, nor did the credit card that was given to him work.  I had to pay the 475 dollar US fee.  

They promised to pay me back when we got to town at the end of the trip, didn't happen. They promised to email me the payment by the end of the week, didn't happen.  As of 7 weeks after the tour Alpha is paying me about 100 dollars every 2 weeks, and I am still owned a couple hundred dollars at this point. Having paid Alpha $4,800 US Dollars for this trip this is unacceptable.

I understand how things can happen, but when you make a mistake you should fix it and act responsibly.  If I didn't harass this operator I don't believe he would have ever paid me anything.

The drivers, Mohammed, Kalifa and David were all nice, professional but I think they could use some feed back from the owner who is just absent.  They should make the effort to stop every once in a while to explain to clients about the area and points of interest.  I think these 3 guys did an ok job but the owner should give them more instruction, or the owner should be there...

Use caution with this operator "
Chris,US,Visited: October 2021,29-Oct-21,50-65,first safari,Ntaba Tours,1,"NTABA is best describe as ""lack of communication"".","I took a Tanzania/Rwanda trip with NTABA in October.

Another bad thing from NTABA is  the tour operator's  lack  of any form of professionalism.  There were numerous comments made during the trip that were highly unprofessional.  Another thing they continually did was try to push their other trips.

First of all: I am rating the office right now and not the mount Kenya hike. The mount Kenya hike is definitely recommendable and was one of the best experiences we had. Great views, great guides (the guides are freelancers and not related to the office)...a wonderful experience! 
But very important! Book this wonderful hike with another (maybe a little bit more expensive) tour operator! Our experience with this tour operator was the worst we have ever experienced (and we are travelling the world for 2 years now). They are robbing you and most of the things they tell you are lies! With this operator you get a reasonable offer and you find yourself paying 20% more than agreed to. Susan seems to be a friendly contact at the beginning and at the end you realize that she only told you half of the truth and lies (if you are not able to pay by US dollars in cash you will pay 10% more than the offer, because the company shifts the financial risk onto the customers, be careful about every ""optional"" they tell you...it will cost you more than expected...for example the ride back at the last day will cost you 50USD which is not included in the price)  they also will make itinerary changes which will affect you with aditional costs without asking you. I really recommend to experience this wonderful hike with another maybe a little bit more expensive company. If you value honesty please avoid Susan and avoid this company, they are thieves."

Christine Holmes,AU,Visited: August 2023,23-Nov-23,65+,first safari,African Sunsets Travel,2,"Poor communicators, frustrating with many changes","We felt that communication was a huge issue in dealing with Sunsets during the tour. There did not seem to be a single point of contact for the group (e.g. various contact points via Gladys, Haron, Lucy, using the Messages function in the booking app). There were times when calls were not taken, and promised return calls not received.
Changes to the itinerary prior to the tour were not specifically pointed out, and still there were more changes during the tour that were not communicated - these changes impacted some of the key highlights that we had all expected from the original itinerary we had paid for.

It was emotionally and physically exhausting having to deal with all the recurrent problems during the tour, even till late at night.

 Initial itineraries indicated that a meeting would be held on Day 1 at 18:00 with the guide and that all members of the group should attend that meeting so as not to miss out on any critical information. This did not occur - we met our guide at the start of day 2. He was surprised to have 7 people on the tour in one vehicle and also at the amount of luggage - which was a problem for him to accomodate safely and securely. No ¢®¡¾PRE-TOUR¢®¡¾ information was provided about luggage or clothing requirements, although this had been requested by many of the group members. This resulted in the tour truck being overcrowded with luggage.

There was confusion about where the tour ended - Arusha or Nairobi. 4 of the 7 people on the tour had confirmed that the tour was to end in Arusha and it was up to them to arrange return either to Nairobi or elsewhere. This was not consistent with the name being called a ¢®¡ÆCircuit¢®¡¾ and as it transpired, it became clear (once on the tour) that we could have all been transported back to Nairobi by road to end the tour - but this was not known to those of us who paid additional money to fly from Arusha to Nairobi.

The drivers/tour guides in both Kenya and Tanzania were friendly and helpful, but they were not employed by Sunsets and had limited ability to fix operational issues - other than be the go -between with the company. However the safari drives were good and we saw lots of wonderful animals thankfully.

I would recommend being very careful about arranging a tour with Sunsets of Africa based on our experience.
We had booked through Tourradar who did help us with some monetary compensation on our return - as all 7 of us agreed we had not received what we had paid for.

Christophe Jouvin,FR,Visited: January 2019,26-Feb-19,35-50,first safari,KAMar Safaris,1,Bad organization and very old uncomfortable vehicles!,"We booked our 5 day safari with ""Hello Tanzania"", and were very disappointed!
For starters, we actually only had 3 parks on the 5 days, since we only went for an hour in a boat on Lake Manyara which is not of great interest. There are certainly more interesting things to see and do in this park. The 3 parks ""Serengetti, Ngorongoro Crater and Tarangire"" were superb ... alas, although our guide is very friendly, we were transported in a very old 4x4 (over 300 000 km on the counter), which was small, noisy and very uncomfortable, and whose air conditioning no longer worked, such as radio (necessary for the guide) ... which made safaris much less enjoyable as well. We met many other companies, and we had the most rotten vehicles of all the parks !!
""Hello Tanzania"" does not have a vehicle, and in fact does not even know in which 4x4 you will be transported ... So look good before booking your safari, and choose a tour operator who owns his own vehicles; you will spend many hours !!"

Christy,US,Visited: April 2019,02-May-19,35-50,first safari,Go Touch Down Travel & Tours,1,"Presentation, contract, itinerary, and actual experience never matched up, and no resolution.","We booked a safari in South Africa at a travel show in Dallas.  We received an itinerary 2 weeks before the trip.  On the trip our experiences were not what was communicated at the travel show, nor on our contract, nor on the itinerary.  The contract says they can change anything they want at their leisure and as a customer there is no recourse.  Many of our safari guides exceeded the 6 passengers, so that small group feel...gone, forget it.  They only allow you to stay at their resorts so there is EXTENSIVE driving to and from every activity.  Our itinerary said we would be on a jeep safari in Kruger, but once we arrived we were told we had to pay an additional 130 for the jeep.  Our trip to Kruger took 3.5 hours to arrive, only got 3 hours on the jeep, then a 5 hour drive back to the resort (Hamala).  It was a miserable day in the van and not worth the drive for such a short safari.  Hamala is a nice resort but dinner is what they choose, not what the customer would like.  They served a steak one night that was too tough to eat.  I told the host the steak was too tough and his response was ""your welcome"", so needless to say I went to bed hungry that night (there were NO other food options provided).  The safari's at Hamala were at 7 am, wake up call at 5:30, coffee at 6:30 and safari from 7-10, then breakfast is at 10am.  I struggled with my blood sugar being up for 5 hours without any food.  I finally had to buy snack cakes at the gas station during an outing.  Persons on the Cape Town tour are flown into JBurg and they say a free night at Seasons resorts to recover from the travel, but all it is, is a sales pitch to buy into the resort, as they then have to fly from JBurg to Cape Town the next day.  We also booked a shark dive with Go Touch Down, they charged us 350 per person.  When we arrived at the shark dive operator we found out the cost is 186 per person. I assumed there would be a small up charge for Go Touch down to book it, but seriously, double the cost.  Save your money and book your own shark cage dive directly with Apex Shark Encounters in Simon's Town, your cost will be cut in HALF.  I will never recommend this company.  I wrote 6 emails during my travels of my negative experience and received NO assistance, many emails I didn't even get a response.  I wasted so much money with the company and want to ensure other people don't get scammed like I did."

We also had to claim dinners, they are already paid and the hotel did not know it. They tried to give us a safari day instead of one morning and one afternoon . And it's not the same! in the heat of the day they are not animals.

Clarissa,US,Visited: September 2016,26-Sep-16,20-35,first safari,Bushfind,1,Do not use this company!,"Our expectations were significantly higher due to the higher price and reviews. WE had a lot of problems: 

1. Our pickup from our apartment was late and nobody contacted us. Instead, our emergency contacts were used, causing extreme distress when our family couldn't contact us in the park. 

2. We were very disappointed that the tour was described as an open safari and we had a closed van that limited our views and ability to take photos. 

3. To add to this, our van broke down in the beginning of the tour and we had to wait for 1.5 hours to have it fixed. The cars for the safari should be in good working order.

4. We paid for 2 cabins and were surprised to learn when we were checking in that we had only one.  Because of this, our guide was kind enough and gave us his room, meaning he had to leave us by ourselves in the campsite.  When we returned from the night safari our guide had left and we didnt have keys to our rooms or knew which rooms were ours.  The keys were supposed to be left at reception but when we arrived it was closed and nobody knew what rooms were ours or who had our keys. After about 30 minutes of uncertainty, the guard was able to provide us keys to our rooms.  We were exhausted and really did not want to have to go through this.

5. The next day we had a 5:20am pickup time that couldnt happen because our guide had not slept in the campsite and could not get into the park, of course no one told this to us, we were awake since 4:30am.  We had woken up at 4:30am and were not picked up until 7:00am.  Our emergency contacts were once again called in the middle of the night (6hrs time difference) causing a big worry to our parents again, as they thought something wrong had happened.  We believe that we also missed the opportunity to see the sunrise and the animals waking up. We were the only ones left in the campsite by the time our guide arrived.  

We we filed a claim and asked for a partial refund due to all our troubles, the company answered stating that they believed they had provided amazing service.

We do not recommend this company at all."
claudia,IT,Visited: August 2019,14-Aug-19,35-50,over 5 safaris,Fig Tree Tours and travel,2,Unprofessional as they did not follow the agreed plan,"I have contacted Fig Tree for the positive reviews and for the reasonable  prices, though, I did not have a good experience for a number of reasons. First of all I was given a program and ended up doing another! So a piece of advise, make sure you are very specific on your requirements, making plenty of research and you get a program confirmed in writing exactly as you have understood it and you want it. I have asked for a 5 nights budget camping safari with 3 nights inside the parks (2 in serengeti and 1 in Ngorongoro) and I got instead a 5 nights with only 2 days inside the parks (1 in serengeti and 1 in Ngorongoro) I never asked to go to Tarangine and we found ourselves spending the first day there instead of Serengeti and slept outside the park. Serengeti is big, if you do not spend at least 2 nights  inside you waste a lot of time traveling between parks and you don¢®?t enjoy much time game viewing! In fact out of so called 5 days in reality you do 4 days of which 1.5 days game viewing and the rest is traveling or waiting). Second of all you need to know if you are going with the actual company car and driver for the whole trip or not. In our case they just gave us a freelancer driver with other people from other agencies, sometimes they do this in case they don¢®?t find enough people to fill the car and they don¢®?t have drivers available. Funny enough we were 6 people coming from different agencies and we all had the same program but ended up doing another one. Or we were all stupid or it is common for agencies to be unclear and unprofessional. We got 2 different drivers in 3 days while another couple which stayed longer got 3 drivers in 4 days ending up wasting time and therefore money (we got delayed a couple of times during the trip for missing payments from the company to the driver, literally 2 hours waiting!). Third of all you need to make sure you clarify in advance the amount of tips to give to the staff; we were told we had to give 10 usd per day per person to the driver but we ended up having to give tips also to the cooker, which was not expected. Ref. Tips it would be much better for the company to pay for the drivers and cookers and include that amount in the overall price! It would avoid misunderstandings and uncomfortable situations and leave the customers choosing if a tip is worth to be given (tips should not be forced!). Fourth of all, be aware of the extremely bad conditions of the public camp sites, overcrowded with dirty facilities! I have been camping several times in Zimbabwe and other places and the experience of the camping is incredible, you are immersed in nature, hearing the animals around you after a nice meal cooked on the fire. In Tanzania the experience is far from this; I have never experienced such crowded camps and you loose completely the connection with nature (if you are in a safari for this reason!). You will only hear people talking, and more, all night and no sound of animal! Also, be aware of the commercialization of the safari and expect many cars around; if you are sensitive about animals conservation it can be quite overwhelming seeing how many cars can surround a lion surely disturbing them... Our driver was old school and very sensitive about this matter which I have appreciated. After all I could not recommend this company as after the trip and discussing the program issue they are still insisting they did nothing wrong. And note I have confirmation in writing of the 3 nights camping from them! Literally unprofessional. "
Clevanne,US,Visited: February 2020,03-Mar-20,20-35,first safari,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,1,Our group was scammed out of $700 USD at the end of our 3 day stay at Masai Mara -AVOID THIS COMPANY,"While I would have loved to leave a positive review after my 3 day stay at Masai Mara, I cannot and will not support or endorse a booking with this company after my experience being scammed at the end of the stay. The group of young women (a total of 5 of us) booked our 3 day tour with Masai Mara since Oct 2019, paying nearly $600 USD that included all lodging accommodations, game adventures, meals and travel to and from our hotel. Not included was the gracious tip we provided to our server, driver and individuals who aided with our luggage during the course of our stay. On the first evening of our stay  (Wednesday 2/2/2020)we were told by our driver Dennis (not the owner of the company)t that there was an ""issue"" with processing our tickets that served as entrance to and from the safari. This issue in no way had anything to do with us of course because we had paid all fees months in advance but clearly this company operates at a deficit and did not have enough revenue to pay for entrance fees that should have been taken care of months before. The issue would now require that each of us pay $140 USD (a total of $700) that would be refunded back to us. Given that none of us had $140 USD in cash, we asked if it would be possible to pay by card to which they responded yes. From this moment it was clear that none of us had enough cash to pay for the park entrance fees that should have already been handled so I would assume if this was a priority they would be diligent about making sure they recieved the payment as soon as possible. The following day (Thursday 2/13/2020), which apparently so happened to be the last day we could pay by card, we never heard anything from Dennis or who we now know as the business owner, Noah Kuti, about this matter. Now we get to our final day (Friday 2/14/2020)...after breakfast we did a brief tour through the safari and began making our way to Naroibi since it was a 6 hour drive away. Roughly an hour later at our first stop (for souvenirs - this is included in the cost), Dennis brings up the payment matter to one of us who had remained in the vehicle during the stop. At this time he stresses that it cannot be paid by card anymore and that we would have to take out cash at an atm or else we would not be able to get back to Nairobi. This was absolutely unacceptable, disgusting, unprofessional and rude. To assume that because we were american we had $700 amongst the 5 us easily laying around to make up for the companys mistake still to this day completely irritates my core. To make a long story short, Dennis ends up bringing us to an atm where one of us is successfully able to withdraw the money after a handful of attempts. Dennis then wires the money to Noah who is able to process the entrance fees. During this time Dennis passes Noah the phones who tells us that he will meet us our hotel at 6:30pm that evening to give us back that full amount in addition to the bank fees we accrued (an additional 40 USD). Please note: We are scheduled to leave nairobi on a 7am flight the following morning and we would make it to our hotel a little before 5pm on that Friday. Now that the payment is made, Dennis drives us to our hotel and provides us with both his and Noahs contact information before leaving. 6:30pm arrives and nothing. At 7:10pm we decide to give Noah a call who tells us that he is at the bank and will be there by 8pm. A little after 8pm while we are eating dinner Noah calls and gives us an excuse about not being able to retrieve money from the bank location he was in. He asks for the account number that we withdrew the money from which we quickly denied as we are told by our banks here in the states to never provide that information. We have since tried to follow up with him (Noah) via email to which the two emails he have responded back have been short and to the effect of ""we are working on your issue"", despite us providing multiple options for him to send the money to us (cashapp, paypal, venmo etc.). It has now been over two weeks and we are still short over $740 as a group for a 3 day safari trip that we paid nearly $3,200 for (including tips). We have now taken this to our banks to report this company as spam and intend to take every single measure to ensure this never happens to anyone again! While we enjoyed seeing the animals this experience was absolutely despicable and a disgrace - my goal is to see that Wildebeest Safaris goes out of business so that company's with integrity can thrive.

Do not book with this man, he will ruin your African Safari Experience. We booked with Image Travel in March 2014 for a 10 day Masai/Serengeti Safari commencing Sep 2014. Paid for the tour in full prior to arriving. Mwanje, the owner, was great to deal with when booking but it all went horribly wrong on arrival. Our driver wasn't paid and we were stranded on the side of the road for 3 hours on the first day. We missed our afternoon game drive and lunch. We went for the 5 star option so for our group we paid over $30k USD for the whole trip. Our first night of accommodation was paid for but after that the next 9 nights had not been paid. The deposit was paid but the remaining amounts were all outstanding. We ended up having to report the matter to police and found that over $20k of the trip had to be paid for again. Our once in a lifetime trip was turned into an absolute nightmare by Mwanje and Image Travel. Mwanje would not respond to our calls or emails. Take my advice and go with another company."

There was one guides who was a wealth of knowledge, but the other two guides (including our truck) barely said anything and when we asked something the answers were short and basic. Also, we asked to go deeper into the park to see the great migration and the drivers made excuses without trying to accommodate us, see how it could work or explain why it couldn¢®?t. Finally, they promised us an ¢®¡Æextra special¢®¡¾ stop on our last day and then didn¢®?t do anything about it even when reminded. Overall there was a lack of info and communication and they just told us what they thought we wanted to hear, true or not."

The pickup was seamless
The drive took 8.5 hours as we got stuck in Mud after entering very rough Terrain in the Mara and it¢®?s a single lane hi way with numerous stops for random construction
Every tour driver stops to help the stranded driver
Nice when we got stuck but after three others got stuck it wasted 2-3 hours of day1
Unfortunately the roads were so bad that in no time my back was out of sync
The rest of the two days was at the wonderful lodge getting pampered by the staff as the only guest on the premises.
The ride back was equally long but after complaining a lot I was given the front seat
Also asked for a refund for the 2 Nd day entry which was given unwillingly
Take the LandRover or Jeeps DO NOT take the MINI VANS
They are uncomfortable unreliable and the drivers are a clique
Ensure you enter the park all 3 days as the charge is for 24 hr entry from first entry
This tour Co only entered the park in the first 24 hours and pocketed $80 USD for 7 passengers
Would not use them again"

The price for the tour was to include all expenses for transportation, food and lodging within Tanzania and admission to the parks and reserves selected. Our initial flight from Dar to Mwanza went smoothly, but our first problem occurred when nobody met us at Mwanza as arranged: effectively we lost half a day before arrangements were evidently cobbled together to get us to our first stop, where our drivers met us the next morning. The next problem occurred when without previous notice, our lodging was changed from Serengeti to tents at a mountain site closer to Ngorongoro - obviously an improvised solution, as we were unprepared for such a cold site and the camp had been hastily set up the day before, and there were insufficient blankets the first two nights; also"

Connie,UK,Visited: November 2023,03-Dec-23,20-35,first safari,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Not as informed and lack of communication,"Before I paid a deposit I specifically checked through email communication if the safari would be in the order I saw on the safari booking website, i.e., day 1 Lake Naivasha, day 2 Lake Nakuru and days 3-4 at Masai Mara. This was so we would get as close to 2 full days at Masai Mara as possible as I was aware the trip would involve a lot of travelling. I was assured by the agent I communicated with by email it would be in this order. 

On day 1 of the tour, when I was picked up, it wasn't until we were almost there and I asked before I was told we were headed to Masai Mara. In the end most of day 1 was spent travelling to Masai Mara and we only spent 2.5 hours on the safari. The very thing I was trying to avoid with my questions! Day 2 was a full day at Masai Mara. To add, the Lodger we stayed at, Jambo Mara, I really liked. 

Day 3 was Lake Nakuru (which in the itinerary I was given we were supposed to go to on day 2). The accommodation, the Waterbuck Hotel is not great. Good breakfast but very rundown rooms with too much noise from outside so it's hard to sleep. Plus no fan or air conditioning.

Day 4 was Lake Naivasha and Hell's Gate, which was supposed to be on day 1. The accommodation, Masada hotel, was better than Waterbuck, bit still not very good and bathroom was quite smelly and mine toilet didn't have a toilet seat. 

What I liked about the safari:

1. I enjoyed the actual safari itself and seeing all the animals.
2. I liked Jambo Mara Safari Lodge.

What I didnt like:

1. Not correctly informed about the itinerary of the trip, even though I asked. 
2. I did a shared safari and everyone was given a different itinerary (i.e., each person was given a different order and some were told we would do a pre-breakfast drive at Masai Mara, which we didnt do). We were all on the safari for a different amount of days so I think the issue was they were trying to accommodate everyone's different schedules. This should have been explained when I asked.
3. The tour guide didn't explain from day to day where we were going and what we would be doing and seemed annoyed when we would ask for information. We were all quite confused from day to day and were never sure what we would be doing."
Constance,US,Visited: March 2022,20-Apr-22,20-35,first safari,Exciting Africa Holidays,1,Disorganized and felt unsafe,"I would warn against booking with this company. I felt unsafe on this trip, particularly once the safari moved from the portion in Kenya to the portion in Tanzania- to the extent that I ended my trip four days early I was frequently handed off between different guides and drivers without a secure way of confirming who was affiliated with the company and who wasn't, and was sometimes left without a guide or driver at all. At the Namanga border crossing I was left by my driver/guide and a local was paid to see me through the process and onto the shuttle to Arusha, Tanzania. I didn't have service in the area, and if anything had gone wrong had no way to contact anyone. I did not know who I would be meeting in Tanzania or have a way to reach them or know when they would be picking me up. Once I was in Tanzania, my itinerary was changed so that I could be shuffled to join other drivers and tour groups. While I was still slated to visit the same places in the end, changing the order meant that my family and friends at home would not know where I was on a given day, which made me uncomfortable as a young, solo female traveler. Because I was being passed between groups, I also didn't know who my driver would be, where I would be going on a given day, or who might contact me with this information and when. When I contacted the company with concerns they didn't see these issues as valid.
Part of the reason I booked this specific tour was because it is advertised as vegan-friendly. Despite letting the company know in advance that I was vegan I was frequently unable to eat anything besides fruit and juice, and had to re-explain what my diet was over and over again. Two days into the trip I contacted the company about this and never received a response. I think it's dishonest to advertise this tour as vegan-friendly.
The guides and drivers were all friendly and honestly trying to help solve my problems, admitting that the way things were being handled was far from ideal, and I saw many beautiful animals, but I don't feel like this was enough to overcome the company's mismanagement.
Other travelers I was with were in similar situations, with their itineraries being changed last minute and sometimes prices being increased beyond expected while they were already on the tour, or having their lodgings changed to cheaper options after they had already paid.
*I found this tour through TourRadar, and though they asked for my review the review I submitted never appeared on the site."
Cornelia Meier,DE,Visited: August 2018,09-Sep-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Kenya,1,The most leaders are asolutely unreliable + the company dont keep promises!Get hurt by a guide,"- The wildlife was absolutely various and we saw a lot of things. 
- The food was most of the time great
- The accommodation was always perfect
- And our first guide was nice

BUT then we get a new guide. Ok we didnt get him, because Dan never arrrived and we didnt get any information about this, even when the hotel called him a lot of times. So we couldnt do the boattrip. The next day, we get a new guide. He was so terrible and drove his car badly. We asked him four times to drive a lit slower and to watch the streets (not his phone). When we finished lunch, we had to wait for him, because he wanted to talk and wait for other drivers. The restaurant was empty then, all the groups left the restaurant before us, even that we were the first group who was arriving in the locals and had to wait after lunch a half our extra for him. 
He had just a normal car, so that we get in stuck in the safari. After that he was so nervous, that when I started to get in, he started to drive. (With my open door) -> so I get hurt and was falling on the ground. He was not nice after this and didnt ask me how I feel. 

After we had also an disappointment with the company and Dan. Our first guide promised us, that Dan will help us with our camera, which we lost at the airport. Yes but noone came. We told the company about this promise and they told us, they called Dan in this moment and he will come now. But Dan didnt know about anything and was not willing to come. We told the company but they dont care.

So when they hadnt change our guide, I would give 5 Stars, but after our first guide everything was bad..... And honestly, with every other company you will see the wildlife. Choose someone else!!!!!!!! "

Having spent a lot of time looking on TripAdvisor prior to selecting our company we decided choose SafariBook Evolution due to their cheap prices and despite their occasional dubious reviews however unfortunately this was a bad decision! Our trip was extremely disappointing and we would advise spending a few more dollars and going with a more trust-worthy company. 

Our guide was disinterested, extremely rude and spoke limited English. He didn¢®?t talk to the group and spoke about us rudely to other tour company guides. He needed to be pushed to go into the park and was reluctant to do so, cutting our time inside the park short on all occasions. 

With regards to the campsite; it was a tented site however was extremely basic; the tents had holes in them, the zips didn¢®?t work, the mosquito nets were dirty and holed, there was limited hot water and no wi-fi despite this being promised. 

Alongside this, and probably our most alarming concern was that our guide had a complete disregard of park rules. He frequently drove off the park tracks, towards animals often causing them to run away in fear much to our surprise. This is obviously wholly inappropriate, not only for the obvious harm it causes animals but also for the future conservation of the park and its tracks.

We have been in back and forth emails with the owner Steve however this has been a fruitless task. We would strongly advise spending a few more dollars and going with a company that is much more trust-worthy. Don¢®?t book with Safaribook Evolution!

We had many problems of logistics and his manager, Mogakolodi Serumola, never helped us. Only it worried about receiving the money. It took breakfasts from us, show restraint, you have dinner, housings in campsites foreseen, it made us pay income to park of our pocket, took us game drives... an authentic shame. Even one night his guide left wire drawing us in the middle of the bush because he was not finding the camp and we had to sleep in the huts of the local some. And the manager never faced the consequences. An authentic calamity of company. A misfortune could have happened for his pathetic management of the safari. An authentic swindle of company."

Cristina,IT,Visited: August 2023,13-Sep-23,50-65,over 5 safaris,Big Time Safaris,1,we suffered a very negative experience and a huge lack of care in our regards,"The trip in Uganda and Kenya with Yaneta Safari was a terrible bad experience.
The only positive aspect was our driver in Uganda; Moses was a perfect guide, he always did all the best to meet our desires and expectations.
We did with Yaneta a 5 five day tour in Uganda and 7 days in Kenya where Yaneta involved Big Time Safaris as a partner. We booked the trip in february 2023 and we have paid everything as stipulated in the contract with Yaneta.

The trip had already some issues in Uganda, but it became a terrible nightmare in Kenya.

1)	the first night in Uganda two out of four rooms did not have a private bathroom instead in the contract it was specified that a private bathroom would always be guaranteed; we did not receive any refund for this.
2)	They booked our flight to Kenya probably at the last moment so we had to fly at 3am, as a result we didn't sleep in any hotel, but we didn't get any refund 
3)	when we arrived in Kenya the Kenyan agency told us that Yaneta had not paid for our trip; we immediately wrote to Yaneta who replied that Big Time Safaris had increased costs at the last moment, Yaneta however did not want to give them more money and therefore had decided not to pay this difference.
4)	Big Time Safaris blackmailed us: pay cash now the difference or we take you to Nairobi and we stop the tour
5)	Yaneta asked us to pay because they were economically in difficulty in that moment and asked us to trust them that we will have receive a refund in short time; we had no choice
6)	We had to pay to finish the tour, but in the meantime we missed a safari in the Masai Park and did not receive any refund for that either; the cost was $80 per person.

We found ourselves in a terrible situation, forced to pay and treated very arrogantly.

Yaneta wrote me in October to be patient that they would have sent us a refund, but now a new year is arrived and we have not receive any pay back.

We have also thought that the two agencies had organized a scam to extort us further money.

A terrible nightmare !!!

Cynthia,US,Visited: July 2019,30-Jul-19,65+,first safari,Kenya Walking Survivors Safaris Ltd,2,The Tanzania part of the trip was a disaster,"There was no driver at Tanzania border for us. The group before us also had no driver show up. The company would not tell us what was going on, and eventually would not answer any of our our calls. So the communication was horrible. We had to spend the night at a hotel by the border and pay for it ourselves (they say they will reimburse us). The next morning, they said a driver would be ready by 10am, but we sat around outside the hotel until 4pm with no word from the office. They were ignoring every call. We were finally met by a taxi driver who transferred us to another driver in Arusha and we had to drive at night to reach the hotel at Lake Manyara at 9:30 pm. As I write this, we are sitting at gate to Manyara Park where we have been waiting for nearly 2 hours, because Kenya Walking Survivors has not transferred money to the Tanzania company so our driver cannot get us in the park. We have no idea how much longer we will wait. They seem to have forgotten to make the necessary arrangements and preparations for our time in Tanzania. Park will not take my credit card because we are in a tour van. So we have lost 2+ days and morning light for photos. We are very unhappy now, and feel that we are wasting a lot of time with only a few days left in Africa. 
Our Kenyan driver was very nice, and the Kenya part of the trip went smoothly. Oddly to me though, on the first day we were picked up, driven to office to pay last half of cost, then to get gas, and then to pick up water. It would have been nice if they had gotten gas and water before picking us up. They had half of the money up front. Our lodgings were nice and the Kenya part went well. I was not expecting the very long long drives on bad roads between the parks. It usually took all day (6-9 h) to go from one place to the next. The law does not allow driving tourists in the dark, so we used up lots of daytime to get from park to park. However, that is the nature of traveling in this area. 

Our main problem has been the horrible experience getting into Tanzania, and getting into the park this morning has been just as bad. Horrible communication, and nothing has been prepared beforehand. "
Cyrille,CH,Visited: March 2017,25-Apr-17,35-50,first safari,Northern Masailand Safaris,1,Terrible company ran by a liar called Henry,"I can confirm what was written by all clients Northern Masailand Safaris is ran by a crook named Henry who litteraly stole our money.
In short here is our story we booked a trip including 1 week safari and 1 week stay in Zanzibar. We agreed on a defined plan (hotels / transport / catering).
We were requested to pay 30% upfront, and the rest upon arrival. 10 days before we start, I received a message that our plans were changed, with cancellation of plane transfer from Serengeti to Zanzibar, against a road trip with a stop in Arusha.
Then I received agressive message requesting the full payment, which I refused. We did not receive any hotel vouchers at that stage.
On arrival day, the hotel that was supposed to be our 1st night was different than the one planned. The next day (a Sunday) Henry wanted to get his cash, but again, without providing any hotel voucher.
This was the begining of a 15 days battle against a liar.
At every stage, the hotel was different than the one we agreed upon, and of course, at a lower category.
When arriving in Serengeti, the driver, genuinely nice and helpful, couldn't find the accomodation, as he did not receive instruction from Henry. Eventually, after having lost 4 hours, we found our deserted place - and of course not the one agreed upon.
We then had a strong argument with the liar to make sure our nice Zanzibar hotel was booked. I had to chase myself the hotel and put pressure on Henry to book it eventually.
Back in transit in Arusha, we agreed for an overall refund of 1000USD. Henry never paid his due !
Last but not least, when leaving Zanzibar, for our transit to the airport, Henry cancelled the taxi, and we had to pay for it .... 
So, in a nutshell, stay away from that company, as this will lead you into much trouble. We were definitively lucky not to have any incident. Without a doubt this liar who have dropped us in the middle of the Savannah.

We were contacted by Lilian who wanted to apologize for what she did. She was asking for forgiveness, that she had learnt her lesson. It really didn't mean much to us because the damage had been done, ruined safari, stuck with driver, all that, not showing up to the police station. She said she would refund the money in full on the condition that we remove the reviews so the group something was up. We told her at least half of the amount because we are not cruel people to demand the whole amount, and based on the circumstances of our ruined safari, we were being unbelievably fair. She went on about how hard things were and of course we are human and were ready to put in a word for her attempt to right the wrong. She offered to give 300 dollars to take down the reviews and for our group of 7 is 42 dollars per person. a fraction of what we had to pay extra on those few horrible days. We weren't gonna start haggling over how much lower we could go but the haggling started again. It was simple, pay the refund she wanted to pay then we put in a good word over the attempt to right the wrong. She mentioned she had a few clients coming in August and that would help her get the money for refunds, (That is the excuse she will use to let you believe she will fix things). She sent the 300 dollars and asked that we remove the reviews??That wasn't even what we had agreed on but then she said that in her own way it was ""giving us the money for park fees"". She then said her conscience was clear since she had finally given us the park fees.How absurd!!! The other twist was that she had the rest of the money actually and that she would pay it in full only if we removed the reviews. We were done with the games and we told her she could run her business however she liked. I said i would write this here to which i received the reply ""I have an alternative I will just pay $300 and have a new website"".""Write as many reviews as you can my dear"". She has quite the taste for mockery. It seems she has done it again to other tourists so avoid Lians Travel."

Travelled difficult and sometimes really dangerous paths, I have never met such bad service as I encountered this August during ""6 Days of Moremi Game Reserve"" in Botswana. The service was provided by Waterlime Mobile Safaris. 
And this is what Waterlime Mobile Safaris can provide:
1.	Guides (Frank and Katee) who lie about travel conditions, change the route without your approval, refuse fresh water, shout at and ignore requests and protests of their customers. 
2.	Guides who are very reluctant to give their telephones to call their agency, and when communicating with their boss speak only their language so that others couldn¢®?t figure out what they talk about.
3.	Guide/ driver (Frank) who instead of driving along the paths for vehicles in National Parks, drives across the bush chasing animals, incl. a female elephant with a baby. 
4.	Guide/driver (Frank) who probably knows nothing about nature and tracing animals and cannot give any information about the area and traces basic animals with big difficulty.
5.	Guide/driver (Frank) who is very willing to sleep with you in your tent and offers his service also at night. 
Now it all looks a little funny but it was not on the spot. 
It was a surprise, and not a pleasant one. I have never expected such a treatment in Africa.

Damian,KE,Visited: February 2017,14-Feb-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,MJ Safaris & Adventure,1,Avoid these guys!,"I have never written an online review but feel I should. 

As soon as I paid my deposit communication suddenly went very quiet and I had to send several chaser emails to find out what was going on. 

Finally a day before we were due to start I received an email 'Pick-up at 6.30am'. 6.30am came and went and at 7.30am I finally received an email response saying 'Call driver 07xxxxxxx'. Not even an apology. You can imagine how stressful this was morning was! When I spoke to the driver on the phone he explained that one of the guests on our safari had a delayed flight and was waiting at the airport. When I met the others they said they all arrived the previous day! Other than that, they hadn't prepared the vegetarian option for lunch which I had requested.

The second day brought more dramas. After being told to wake up at 7am for an 8am start we were all extremely frustrated to find the driver had disappeared. He eventually came back at 10am and explained that his boss hadn't put the funds on his company card. We missed out on 2 hours in the Ngorongoro crater because of this.

We were promised extra time in Serengeti to compensate for this but on the 3rd day exactly the same thing happened! The driver even asked if anyone could pay the balance on their card and that his boss would refund through the web! 

I know they offer extremely cheap packages but no saving is worth the stress of waiting around to get into a park on a once in a life time trip. Pay a little bit more and avoid MJ Safaris."""

Kitau just sells safaris. They contract out to Earths Heart Safari The Safari car provided from Earth Hearts Safari was unreliable from the start.  It had a dead battery in the parking lot when dropped off.  Men showed up with a new battery that was also dead.  I had to help push the car to jump start it.  After we got out of town on the highway, it would not go over 50 KPH and kept dying, but would restart.  I started texting Rhamadi Kitau but no answer.  We pulled over to put water in the radiator because it was running hot. Another text, no answer.  I asked the driver for another vehicle but his boss said no.  We crawled for hours reaching Tarangire very late. The lunch provided was stale and tasteless.  No one ate it including the driver. We toured the park and headed to the camp.  It was past sunset and we were met by strangers in a van to take us to the camp so we could still get supper because we were so late. More texts to Kitau with no replies.  It was all on Whats app and you can see if someone views your texts.  He had. Same safari vehicle showed up with new fuel filter and running fine so we hit the road to Serengeti. Going up the mountain pass we had a flat tire.  The jack did not work because it was so caked with dirt.  Other vehicles kept passing us so we had to keep stopping trying to change the tire.  I finally got the jack to work enough to get it up enough to change the tire but it would not go down all the way and the driver ended up driving off of it as soon as we could get the tire to touch the ground.  2 hours lost. Spare was about half full of air. More texts, no reply. We pulled over on the road about 2:30 for lunch, far short of the ""Serengeti Park gate at Noon"" lunch described.  3:15 the low spare tire blew out. More time lost and  got to the park gate 4 hours late. Another text, still no reply from Kitau. Headed for the the camp.  There would be no promised game drives today as it was now dark. Boom.  Third blowout.  No spare.  Stranded in the desert and pitch black. One of the women in the group began crying. Our driver reached another in the camp and he headed to us with another tire.  A different vehicle came along and offered one of their spares.  Changed tire 3 and headed to camp.   after just a few minutes we hit a big bump and the headlamps went out.  We had to drive with the lights from the vehicle behind us.  We almost struck a hippo crossing the road because we could not see it clearly with no lights of our own. WE got to camp very late, the only ones in the dining area.  Missed entertainment.  I finally tried to call Kitau but he would not answer.  We all got together and demanded another vehicle.  The driver was talking to his boss at Earths Heart but he refused to talk to me.  I tried to take the phone out of his hand. but he hung up when he heard my voice.  The driver said he could only get another vehicle tires and working headlights.  Off we go.  It wans only then that Kitau first texted me (2 for us in the morning while he got ours ""fixed"". Still no answered calls or texts from Kitau.  We were forced to accept this offer.  The vehicle in the morning was good and superior in every way than the one originally provided.  We insisted we wanted to continue in that one.  He said he would ask but he drove off while we were eating.  The original vehicle showed up with new 1/2 days later)  and said he was ""sorry and was working on it"".  No more game driving.  We had to get on the road to Ngorongoro.  Missed the sunset over the crater.  No surprise as we had not seen one yet as promised. He had to take two riders over to another campsite as they needed to go back to Arusha. More calls and texts to Kitau.  No answer.  The driver ended up spending the night there so we missed the early game drive waiting on him to get to our camp.  We started down into the crater 2 hours late.  When we got to the floor of the crater he announced the clutch had gone out and the safari vehicle would not move.  Still no help or answered phone from Kitau. They started putting us in other safari vehicles that had empty seats so we could continue and there would be no ""fixing"" ours.  A replacement vehicle showed up at lunch time and they picked us all up from the other vehiclemove around to take a photo.. This vehicle had no radio to listen to, to hear where animals were being spotted in the park, so we just drove  around aimlessly till it was time to leave.  Believe it or not, this is not the full story of everything that went wrong.  The total apathy by Kitau and Earths Heart Safari was inconceivable to me as a seasoned traveler.  There was never any offer of a refund, even a  partial one for all of the game drives missed ( probably a full 8 hours) anxiety and fear for our safety.  There was no excuse for putting us in a vehicle that was both unsafe and unreliable.  I have been all over the world and have never experienced such an irresponsible and apathetic service as I did from the companies of Kitau Tanzania Safaris and Earths Heart Safari.  Through 4 days of this constant mayhem neither company had the guts so talk to me or provide an answer or resolution to the problem.  We all were taken advantage of and if you spend your money with either of them, do not be surprised it this happens to you as well. There are plenty of other companies out there and it is hard for me to think they are as bad as these two.   Don't waste your money with these two companies.  Travel is my passion.  It still lives, even though these two tried to kill it.

Well it was not, it appears that the group I was in was too large for the company so they had to hire an external contractor, 3 busses from the conpany, one outsider. The best experience was the outside contractor. There was no coordination between the drivers, it almost appeared that the 3 drivers from the company had a problem with the outside contractor and did not support him in any way. The 4th driver with the people he had in his care were abandoned 2 times on the safari, one time for 1 hour and a half, when the bus could not move and see anything because the papers for the bus were with the other drivers. So 7 people out of 27 missed a part of the safari, the only encounter with a leopard. After all this, at the end of the safari we were suppose to cross the river and see the big migration, but the car we were in could not cross, luckily we were taken by a total stranger group ... otherwise we would have missed it. Last but not least our driver kept being harrassed by the others to drive faster on public roads, break the speed limit and really put our lives in dager with unsafe driving, I have seen him being called literally every 5 minutes, I felt UNSAFE! So yes ... poor experience in one of the most amazing places in the world!"

BEWARE!!,"I did a 15-day tour booked with this company (they also call themselves Cheno Travel Safari Tours sometimes) ant it was just terrible!! They did not follow the schedule, didn?? t put us in the accomodations we were planned to stay. We never had water or lunch during our trips (but we paid for it!). It was just a big mess and we had to argue the whole way of our trip, until a point on the 10th day where our driver just abandoned us in our hotel in the Nxai Pans and never returned. We had to figure out a way to keep our trip by ourselves and they never refund us or made anything easier for us. We are still in touch with the Botswana Ministry of Tourism and the police as well to put these guys out of the market forever! If you don??t believe me, just ask for pictures of their cars and their tourism licenses before booking anything. All tour company cars in Botswana must have the logo of the company on the car door. Just ask to see what they have... We rode on an old honda fit without a/c... you just don?? t wanna any of this in your vacations!"
Daniel,ES,Visited: August 2018,08-Dec-18,20-35,first safari,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,1,THE WORST EXPERIENCE POSSIBLE,"Terrible experience! I went with my family to try to see the great migration and thanks to local guides and not our driver we found it but our driver Linos refused to go. First, he asks us for money and they didn't say anything in the company, which we refused, then he began to speak violently and kept us standing for two hours.
 When we got internet we called 7 wonders and they informed us that for the 3 hours we had already lost we should book another hotel in the area where the great migration was and pay 2 taxes from the natural parks.
We agreed to pay, we reserved the hotel on our own and when we said to go, the driver Linos refused again, demanding payment in cash. We call 7 Wonders again and they tell us that we must pay in cash.
We take out all the money we have in cash and we are missing 160 USD to reach the amount of 1050 USD that they ask us to pay the park taxes and we inform them that when we go through an ATM we will pay them the amount that is missing.
It is at this time that the situation becomes totally surreal. The driver Linos calls the company and makes up a story that we have insulted him and that he is not going to take us to the area of the great migration where we had already reserved and paid for a hotel minutes before. We called the company and he told us, to our surprise, that we had offended his driver and that the new plan was cancelling.
I insist, at no time did anyone say anything offensive to the driver Linos.

We missed the chance to see the great migration.
We lost 662 USD from the hotel we had booked.
We had to put up with another day and a half with this driver and his derogatory comments about what he called our white money.
We had to see Ngorongoro with a negative environment and with 0 explanations.
We had three car breakdowns along the way.
Tanzania is beautiful. There are many Safari companies.
I think that in our case, perhaps more than being a problem with 7 Wonders, it was a manipulation and attitude of the driver.
He wanted to share the experience because no one should go through the situation that we live."

The guides / drivers are not professionals and they do not have the necessary education. The exception is in the team of cooks, who do a great job.
As a reference, I must say that we did another safari in Kenya and it was completely opposite, we were with great people and professional people.
You should avoid contracting with this agency, and if it is part of a Kenya-Tanzania combined, you should specify to the Kenyan agency that you do not hire Sandlans Safari for the part you will make in Tanzania."
Daniel,CH,Visited: July 2019,05-Aug-19,20-35,over 5 safaris,Kenya Walking Survivors Safaris Ltd,2,Unfortunately NOT satisfying!,"We booked and paid our trip 6 months ago already and our trip started mid July. Unfortunately it all started with a misunderstanding already when we had our meeting/introduction in the beginning. Because we had organised a city walking tour ourselves after the intro (which we told OT about beforehand) but he he other plans for us which were at the same time he tried to move things and told us our tour would start a day later, which we actually didn¢®?t really want. He said not to worry, we should relax and the guide in Ugands will be informed about the day that was supposed to be scratched from our trip (which we also didn¢®?t want). We had to then start our trip a day later than expected, which was a pity but ok, because at the end of our trip we had an extra day before our flights went. We had also booked a hotel ourselves for that last evening. 

When the trip finally started we had a fantastic first guide named Frederick who was very knowledgable and told us a lot about the animals, the country and it¢®?s culture. After that we had friendly drivers but not really someone I would call a guide. They weren¢®?t very talkative and didn¢®?t inform us. 
We started getting worried in Uganda when our guide wasn¢®?t informed by the office of the change in itenerary and it was even possible to change it. We then sent OT an email, complaining about how he handled the situation in the first place and that he shouldn¢®?t scratch one day of our safari because we actually paid for it. Furthermore we just wanted to know how the rest of our safari would go because now it was all a bit confusing how it would continue. And if we would stay for the whole trip then we would have to cancel our hotel for the last evening. He hadn¢®?t replied ( which was odd because before our tour started the office replied VERY quickly) for more than a week. We asked our guides/drivers to ask the office to contact us because they must be in contact with the office all the time. The drivers just answered that they couldn¢®?t reach the office, which was also very odd because they had to get info from the office to change drivers. After the 3rd driver told us that story we knew it was bullshit. We phoned and got through immediately twice!! Unfortunately OT was NEVER available to talk, he never phoned back and after a those two phone calls we weren¢®?t able to get through either. They blocked us.
Then we told our driver to take us to the office on our way from Naivasha to Kenyan boarder, because the LACK OF COMMUNICATION AND THE NON-EXISTING CUSTOMER SERVICE really frustrated us. At the office we couldn¢®?t get answers to why they had never replied and we found out that our itenerary had been changed by OT (via phone) which was a big surprise to us. If we hadn¢®?t demanded to go to the office we would have never found out because the drivers didn¢®?t know about the change. 
Then we went to the boarder to Tansania. We waited for 2 hours for our next driver, who had more than enough time to get there on time, just to find out that he wasn¢®?t coming anymore and we should stay st a nearby hotel. No one from the office called us to inform and update us, not even to say sorry for the inconvenience. The next morning we waited for an update until 10:30 (we actually tried to phone and find out what¢®?s going on-that didn¢®?t help because they didn¢®?t know themselves and they didn¢®?t have a plan B) that our next driver would be there at 11. We waited at the boarder again just to wait for 2 hours AGAIN!! He finally got there but we basically missed a whole day and we missed a game drive. 
The next guide named Francis in Tansania was great as well. At last we could enjoy our trip again. We had two great days in Ngorongoro and Serengeti. Our last day, because our trip started a day late, we had to speed from Serengeti to Nairobi airport to catch our flight in the evening. Why OT planned the last day like that we will never know. He said there was enough time to even do a game drive in the morning and get to Nairobi Airport on time in the evening. That was bullshit. We even asked him to change it but he said it would be fine. We missed our last game drive and the guide had to drive 140km/h on a 80km/h road to get us there on time. 

Summary
The things we saw during our trip were amazing!! We had two great guides. 
BUT the people working in the office and especially OT have been incompetent and very unprofessional. There is a total lack of communication at a time when it should be the best ever because it was DURING our trip, and there is definitely no customer service whatsoever!!! It was really disappointing because before our trip they seemed very professional and they responded very quickly to emails.
 
I just hope we, and other groups we met that also had a lot of problems which were even worse than ours, had some bad luck and that other groups won¢®?t be stuck with this kind of mess! "
Daniel,UK,Visited: August 2016,17-Sep-16,20-35,first safari,Big Time Safaris Ltd,2,3 day Masai Mara,"We got picked up at 6.30 am and went to the office of Big Time. But the thing they do is that all the companies try to fill up their buses and so we were driving for probably four more hours through Nairobi to pick up people from other companies. This caused us then to arrive at the camp so late that we couldn't go out for safari anymore. The plan was then to start the next day really early with breakfast at 5.30 to compensate the missed time and to see the sunrise.  But this didn't work out because there was no breakfast until 6.15am so we also missed the sunrise. The rest of the day was really awesome, we saw a lot of animals and the Masai Mara national park is really worth a visit. When we asked in the evening for water they told us that there's only 1 liter each per day and in my opinion this is too less if they say that water is included! 
On the third day we actually made it to see the sun rise and left to Nairobi at 8am and arrived at home around 4pm. Besides that we had a driver who wasn't speaking at all to our group and was racing all the time so that we were just shaking in the bus the whole time. It would have been nice if he would have explained sometimes things about Masai Mara but at least he knew the ways there very well. 
So I definitely would recommend to go to Masai Mara National Park but in my opinion not with the Big time company. Probably spending more money would be worth it. "

The first stop for lunch was fine, but he disappeared for a significant amount of time, and said nothing. So we were waiting, wondering where he went.  The places we stayed were excellent, and had really great food! The gorilla trekking experience was phenomenal, definitely bring proper hiking pants, which would have been nice to know. We had booked our tour late, but an email saying what to bring/expect would have been nice.  Also, after our 7 hour trek, Primate Journey was supposed to provide water and there wasn't any, and after asking to stop for water, he said he'd get it later (I think he didn't feel like going outside in the rain), which he never actually did get us water. The last day, Samuel was supposed to pick us up at 9:30 am and didn't show up till 11:40 am. Very frustrating, as neither of us wanted to be driving in the dark (8 hour drive ahead of us) and we had called and texted him, with no response. Overall,  the gorilla experience was incredible but I would never recommend Primate Journeys to get you there"

I¢®?ve had over 30 safaris and he is truly a fantastic guide who tries to meet his clients needs. The chef was also amazing. I did not expect to be fed so well.
Now the bad. One of the guides got very intoxicated the first evening and we did not see him again until 36 hours later.sadly it gets worse. We had are tent broken into and some of our money stolen. They left some money and my iPad so it could have been worse. Outlook claims that this was the first time that it had ever happened with guests commonly leaving everything in their tents with no issue. One the last day they even ask you to leave your tents completely open with your belongings. Strike 3 is that they told us to expect a email from our booking agent (not sure what that means) but it¢®?s been over 36 hours later and nothing yet,"
Dave,US,Visited: August 2018,13-Sep-18,50-65,over 5 safaris,World Escapes & Adventure Travel,1,"""World Escapes"" nearly RUINED our Africa vacation","""World Escapes & Adventures"" nearly RUINED our recent Africa vacation! We paid in full, months in advance, for a camping safari in southern Kenya, transfer to a second subcontracted tour operator in Tanzania, a night in a hotel in Arusha Tanzania, a second safari in Tanzania, then another hotel night in Arusha and transfer to Arusha airport for a few additional days of independent travel. The dates were for August 24th to September 10th 2018.

The first part, in Kenya, which they handled directly with their own staff, was fine. But everything after that was a disaster. They completely screwed up all of the arrangements with the subcontracted Tanzania company and with the Tanzania hotel reservations.

The 'transfer' was supposed to be our Kenya guide driving us to the Kenya/Tanzania border to hand us off to the second guide. But the guide drove us to a restaurant in Nairobi and left us with a second staff member, who then turned us over to a THIRD staff member after lunch, who then put us and our luggage on a PUBLIC BUS and then he LEFT US with no instructions! And once the bus left Nairobi we found out it wasn't stopping at the border, it was going all the way to Arusha! So apparently the plan had changed without us being informed. When we got to Arusha, the bus stopped at a hotel that was not the ""Roika Inn"" as stated in our written itinerary, and this new hotel didn't have reservations for us. They called the Roika Inn for us and - the Roika didn't have reservations for us either! We ran back to the bus stop and found the driver and he agreed to call ""World Escapes"" for us (our phone didn't work in Tanzania) and they told him we had reservations at a THIRD hotel, which we had never been told about, the 'Tourist Inn"". And if the bus driver hadn't generously agreed to drive us there, we would have been on our own in the middle of the night trying to find a way to get to this hotel.

Then the next day, the new tour company informed us that World Escapes had never paid them for our tour! We got back on the phone with World Escapes and were told a strange story - they had put several hundred dollars of my full payment back onto my credit card on the previous day (I had no way to access my bank records and verify this), and it was now MY responsibility to pay the subcontracted tour company! Good luck accessing that amount of cash in the middle of the Serengeti...

I was able to work out arrangements with the second company whereby I paid for our Serengeti park entry fees using a credit card (the bulk of the amount in question) and then use an ATM to pay them the remaining smaller amount in cash. I would have to check my bank records when I got home and figure out what had really happened with this strange unauthorized ""refund"" onto my card...

Then World Escapes began avoiding calls from the subcontracted Tanzania company for the duration of the second safari, so the Tanzania company had no idea what hotel they were supposed to take us to after the safari. We called the ""Tourist Inn"" where we had been a few days earlier, and not only did they not have any new reservation, they told us World Escapes NEVER PAID THEM for the night we had already stayed there!

I was finally able to get World Escapes on the phone on the last day of the Tanzania tour and demand that they tell us the name of the hotel they had booked for us for the final night (and pointed out that I HAD ALREADY PAID FOR THIS!) and asked them to confirm they had paid for transfer to the airport the next day, and there was just a long silence.... and then they said ""Let me get back to you"". And of course, THEY NEVER CALLED US BACK.

Fortunately the Tanzania company came to the rescue. They own a small B&B in Arusha and had a spare room, and they let us stay for free, fed us breakfast the next morning, and even drove us to the airport for no charge.

The excellent service in Tanzania was from a company called ""Hekima Safaris"" and I can highly recommend them.

But - DO NOT USE WORLD ESCAPES AND ADVENTURES. The way they handled our tour plans was completely unprofessional, inept, irresponsible, and unethical. AVOID THEM. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED."

The wildlife there is brilliant but I was less than impressed by Kiboko. The staff in Zambia have good hearts and are well meaning but lack proper training. The staff in Malawi are only interested in the money. Five examples of this would be the ordinary food served despite a better variety available in the local market (training), cooks and drivers masquerading as wildlife guides (training and costs), drivers driving leaving no one to spot the wildlife (costs), the snake in my tent getting through a gap in the door (poor facilities) and the refusal by the management in Lilongwe to take me to my hotel at the end of my safari when it was less than 2km away (costs). The driver lied to me on a number of points with regard to this. This would have cost them less than $2 to do this. I had paid $975 for the six day safari. OK Kiboko is a budget safari company but they are more interested in money than good service."
Dave,NG,Visited: June 2023,13-Jul-23,35-50,first safari,Kenya Bush Expeditions,2,Nairobi Park 1/2 day tour----The Gilligan's Island 3 hour tour.,"It was advertised as a 4-5 hour tour, it was less than 3 hours in the park.

Our expectations were not high so the bar was set low and they couldn't even meet that.
 
After everyone was picked up at 1:30 we were told ""all the animals are asleep now and the best time to start is 3 pm.""  So to kill time we drive to a small souvenir shop/snack place for about an hour.  

First question is if there nothing to see until 3 then why not pick us up at 2:30 instead of 1:30?  Obvious answer---to take us to some place to spend money where I suspect the driver and/or company is getting a kickback.  THIS ANNOYED ALL THE PASSENGERS (we talked about it) since it was very obvious what was going on.
 
So we get to the park entrance at 3 and by the time everyone has paid the entrance fee we head in around 3:20.  Funny thing is there were numerous vehicles in the park already and we pass a few LEAVING.  Didn't they know the animals were all asleep when they arrived a few hours ago? lol.

Long story short what we saw was Virtually nothing, certainly nothing of interest until 30/40 min. in when we saw a pride of lions sleeping (they should be awake, don't they know what time it is?).  There were long stretches of nothing but in the end did see both black (2) and white (2) rhinos,  lots of zebras and 3 giraffes only because we happen to see them far off and luckily they were headed in our direction so we stopped and waited.  We pass that area 30 min. earlier or later and we don't see them.  We also saw lots of Impala, one Ostrich, a couple of hartebeest and 3 hyenas.

They tell you up front in their ads there are no elephants so we knew that.
All we saw of the ""big 5"" was Lions and Rhinos so no leopards or buffalo either.  Also no cheetahs, wildebeast, Hippos, baboons or crocodiles or well....anything else.  Of course there's luck involved and no one should expect to see everything but this was pathetic.  We headed out of the park before 6 pm so the tour was less then 3 hours long.  

The whole thing was more like a Gilligan's Island 3 hour tour gone wrong then an interesting African safari of any kind."
David,US,Visited: July 2016,23-Jul-16,50-65,first safari,Somak Holidays,2,Disappointed a real shame and ruined honeymoon,"I never want to write a negative review but on this occasion I must as we were badly let down.  Despite being notified at an early stage Somak failed to register that this was our honeymoon trip.  In our group of 6 there was another honeymoon couple and they received  special treatment but my wife and I did not, this lasted for the 7 days of our safari.  This culminated with the last stage of our trip on Zanzibar when we arrived at the hotel and I told staff it was our honeymoon.  However,  they told us that they had not been notified of this, so we were denied the honeymoon package.  I spoke with the Somak rep and he said he would pass the complaint on to his manager, and that the manager would meet us at the hotel the following day.  He never came, in fact they just avoided us for the duration of the stay and did nothing.  Thankfully the hotel guest relations manager became aware of the situation and stepped in to made our last three days special.

It is a real shame that we suffered this negligent communication error as the safari driver was great and he was tireless in searching for the fauna we wanted to see.  Another plus was the Serena lodges we stayed at which were fantastic.  To date we still have not even had a reply from Somak to offer an apology..."
David,UK,Visited: February 2016,01-Mar-16,50-65,2-5 safaris,Africa Remote Safaris,1,"Beware - Unilateral changes in Itinerary, last minute flight changes, hotels not reserved","We booked a 10 day safari to Kenya and Tanzania followed by 4 days in Zanzibar. We were a group of four. Upon arrival, we were picked up at the airport and transported to our hotel, only to find out there was no reservation for us and the hotel was full. This required us to move to another hotel (much inferior in quality). The next morning, a representative of Africa Remote met us and indicated that the payments we had made one month earlier were still being held by their credit card agency and we would have to pay for the night's hotel plus US $160 (cash) for that day's entrance into Nakuru Nat'l Park - but that they would refund the money to our credit card. This they did but because we are not American, we do not travel with a lot of U.S. cash. We were told the money we paid should soon be available and everything would be O.K. Not so. When traveling from the Masai Mara to Amboseli Nat'l Park, we passed through Nairobi and were told the same representative needed to see us again. This time, were told we were required to pay the entrance fees into Amboseli - another $160 cash. Our U.S. cash reserves were getting very low at this time. We were assured everything would be O.K. once we crossed into Tanzania. The next day when we met our Tanzanian, guide we asked if all fees were paid. His response was that we were to pay the entrance fees for the parks. It took him over an hour to clarify our situation with the Nairobi office, but still we had to pay the entrance fee to Tarangire Nat'l Park. All these fees were eventually refunded. This is when things really started to go wrong. On our drive from Tarangire to Ndutu Tented Camp, our guide received a text message from the office that advised him to stop early at a 1 star (at best) roadside hotel until he could complete some necessary banking the next day. In other words, our accommodation at Ndutu had not been reserved or paid for. We wasted half a day at this hotel with absolutely nothing to see or do. The next day, we set off again and had to wait over 2 hours while our guide completed the banking. This resulted in a very late drive over some questionable tracks after the sun had set. To say it was nerve racking is an understatement. On our way out of Ndutu, it was obvious that no accommodation had been booked for the night. We had paid in advance to stay at the Rhino Lodge but ended up in the Bouganvillea Lodge (very pleasant, but cheaper) after our guide had a heated exchange with his office. What a surprise in the morning when we found out we had to pay for the night at the hotel ($186). That day was our flight to Zanzibar, which, at the request of Africa Remote, we had paid $280 each in May of 2015 - we were told it was necessary to pay early because the flights sell out. We had asked for the flight itinerary and when we passed through Nairobi were told that we were flying Precision Air at 1:15 from Arusha's domestic airport. At 9:00 a.m. we finally got our flight itinerary. We were now flying Fast Jet at 12:30 from Kilimanjero airport - over 2 1/2 hours driving away. They had booked us at the last minute on a Low Cost carrier (the tickets cost them less than $124 each -in other words, they made a lot of money). Our driver drove at breakneck speed to get us to the airport. We made it to the check in counter with less than 2 minutes to spare. Then we found out our flight not only had a 6 hour layover in Dar es Salaam, but we were charged luggage fees for each flight segment (another $ 70). Upon arrival late in the evening in Zanzibar, there was no one to meet us as had been promised. We made our way by taxi to the hotel listed on our itinerary (Pongwe Beach Hotel) only to find, once again, that no reservation had been made. Fortunately, the manager was very accommodating, had room for us and said he would work everything out the next day. He got an e-mail in the morning telling him to expect our arrival and ""customer to pay"". In other words, they had not paid for this hotel either. The manager tried to contact Africa Remote by e-mail and phone but had no luck. We ended up paying for this hotel for the three nights we stayed ($600). Pongwe Beach Hotel is a gem! Pongwe Beach even arranged our transfer and  stay at our next destination in Stone Town. Africa Remote ended up owing us a considerable amount of money. It took them almost a month to process a refund. We are lucky because we had the resources to weather this situation. It might not be so for other travelers.  Even though the two guides we had were excellent (Simon in Kenya and Hamza in Tanzania) the front office ruined this experience. We wasted time in hotels, while they were banking and sitting in an airport departure lounge. They caused us far more stress than any other trip that I have taken - and I have traveled to over 90 countries. I would never recommend this company! "
David,DE,Visited: July 2019,28-Aug-19,20-35,first safari,Wild Root Safaris,2,Safari with problems,"We did a 7 (8) day safari on Wild Root. The track and the accommodations were put together in advance by Wild Root and offered as a finished trip.
Overall, it was a nice safari, but there were three serious problems from my point of view.

1. Booking the accommodations for the wrong month
When we arrived after our first day of safari at the first TWC accomodation booked by Wild Root, we were told after a long wait that the accomodation was overbooked. All other accommodations on our safari belonging to the TWC group are booked for the wrong month. We were then taken that same evening to another (45 minutes) away TWC accommodation that was still vacant in the room. This of course was not the class of our booking and at the actual accommodation included morning guided hike to Lake Manyara we also could not attend. In addition, we did not know at this time if and how our safari goes on at all, which absolutely destroys a relaxing holiday! To top it off, there were problems with the Rangers the next morning because we were not registered for the passage to the property. After much discussion with our rangers about the ranger, we had to turn around and return to the accommodation, where we had to pay another 64 dollars out of our own pocket to drive the way. After over an hour, we finally went on with the safari. The $ 64 did not matter, I was much more annoyed by the renewed stress and lost time. We paid almost 1,000 a day for the safari, so I expect that such problems will not occur.

2. Planning error
Another of my serious and avoidable mistakes was planning the location of one of the accommodations. For two days of safari the Mara River Crossing was scheduled. For this one must necessarily drive north to the Mara River in the north of the Serengeti. Man then waits at the river for a possible crossing by the animals waiting on the other side. Unfortunately we had to leave our position early because our accommodation (Lobo Lodge) was 3 hours drive from the Mara River. So we went when others arrived. From our oncoming drivers, our driver was asked several times, why we leave the river already. The next day we have renounced a return trip to the Mara, because then a total of 6 hours drive to the relatively short time at the Mara are out of proportion. I do not understand why no accommodation was chosen near the Mara. In my view, a planning error that you could have avoided. In addition, the immigration had left the area Lobo and accordingly were found few animals.

3. Unreliability and dangerous ride to the airport
At the end of the safari actually (so it was planned from the beginning) a final meeting with the leader Phil in Arusha should be done. Since our jeep was no longer safe driving, because this lost brake fluid due to a defect, the car should be replaced for the trip to the airport (about 1 hour). Unfortunately, Phil did not show up at the rendezvous, as agreed with our driver and us. We waited about 30 minutes for Phil who did not show up, then had to go to the airport with the broken Jeep not to miss our flight. Not to appear to the meeting is one thing, not to put us a replacement car and so to force our driver to continue the ride on a train with braking problems is in my view an absolute ""no-go""!

I will book another company for the next safari and in my experience would not recommend Wild - Root.

David,DE,Visited: September 2023,29-Sep-23,35-50,first safari,African Polecat Safaris,1,7 day safari tour with chaotic organization and downgrades,"We did a seven day safari tour organized by African Polecat including Tarangire NP, 3 days Serengeti NP, Ngorongoro Crater, Biking to Lake Manyara and a cultural tour and finally a walking tour at Arusha NP.

First of all, doing such a safari tour is an amazing experience and we can really recommend it - just not by this operator.
We specifically chose this tour because accomodation-wise it offered a nice combination of 3 nights of sleeping in tents in the nature (with animal encounters right in front of the tents!) and then really nice locations at the start and end, namely 2* the jungle pearl resort and 1* karibu heritage.
Starting the first day, we were told, that there would be a change in plan, with Arusha NP at the first day, rather than the last day- which was fine to us at the moment, but then after a very nice safari day we were dropped off at a cheap Hotel in Arusha that was not even on the travel list, costs less than half as much and is badly rated on google maps and booking (3/10!!). A place we never would have chosen or booked ourself. The next day we were mixed with another group and picked up by another driver and guide. We thought we would continue with the initial guide - which was no problem per se - but sad because this way we didnt had the chance to tip the initial tour guide which did a spectacular job explaining all the animal encounters. With the new - suddenly scrambled together - group, the journey continued but we ended up at different accomodations than booked.
After Tarangire we were driven to kizumba camp site instead of jungle pearl (also not as nicely rated, rather basic in comparison). We texted James (the organizer) why this was the case and he said he forgot to remind the driver.
On day 6, we had only a short day at Ngorongoro crater, because the rest of the group and the driver would go on to Arusha for the afternoon, which was not on our plan anymore. So we were dropped off along the way at jungle resort (even then the driver didnt get the right instructions for us; we basically had to make sure to arrive at the right place; even the location didn¢®?t know of our supposed arrival). Any way we lost half a tour day because apparently we were mixed with another group which had a different tour plan. 
The last day at manyara lake we were a little bit worried to not reach the planned arrival at the airport in the evening with all the organizational problems. When texting James he ensured us that a driver will pick us up and everything is arranged. When sitting in the final taxi, we thought that now nothing could surprise us anymore, when suddenly the taxi would drive to a place in Arusha and drop us off there, instead of at the airport. After waiting there for 20 minutes a second taxi drove us to the airport. Again without previous communication.
It is indeed a very weird feeling, when you are in a foreign country and half the time you enter a vehicle, you get dropped-off at a random place that was not communicated or agreed on.
Minor inconveniences: no binoculars as advertised, no beverages or alcoholic drinks as advertised, no 3l water a day as advertised, no hot shower water as advertised, no toilet paper (we thought to really expect those things would be a stretch, given the nature of the safari, but still¢®?).
Erika the cook and Amos the guide were lovely and I don¢®?t feel like they are at fault for any of these problems. It very much felt like a lack of communication and providing organization and information.

A safari tour is very much recommended and a once-in-a-lifetime experience, but I cannot recommend Polecat as operator.

David and Pam,US,Visited: August 2022,04-Sep-22,50-65,first safari,Afrishare Trekking & Safaris,1,Bait and switch!!! Lier!!! Find a different safari operator!!!,"Afrishare does not even rate one star! 
     Let me start by telling you that I am in the charter business and very familiar with bad tour operations. We did a seven day private tour in 4 parks. The Masai Marain in Kenya The Serengeti and Ngorongoro  crater and Tarangire in Tanzania.
     If Abrahim Juma Mkwizuthe (the owner) lips we¢®?re moving he was lying, He lied about vehicles, time spent in wildlife parks, accommodations, travel times, and what was included in his advertised package. On your website!
     Meet and great at the airport upon arrival in Nairobi Kenya to meet our driver and taken to our hotel. Afrishare did not show. We had to get a taxi. The guide was not informed of our arrival until we were at our hotel.
    The drivers were great but the vehicles were junk, absolutely trash, you could not see out the windows, the seats were not functional, not safari vehicles,  one was a 20 plus year old two wheel drive van with no working Vhf. bald tires. The radios that professional operators use to communicate with other drivers to locate the animals. We were sent pictures of new safari vehicles that we would be in, these were not the ones provided. You had to lay the seat back to see out of the window! And could not see out the front! I cannot imagine if there were more than my wife and I in the vehicle.
     Once deposit was made Accommodations that we¢®?re advertised in the park we¢®?re now fully booked and unavailable Afrishare  replaced these with inferior lodging outside the park. Afrishare then saved money by having the driver do a game drives outside the park, therefore only  having to pay for one day in  Serengeti park, not two as advertised  saving park entrance fees ( anyway this man could cheat you out of a dollar he would)
      Travel times between mas?a Mara park and Serengeti  5 hours turned into 11 hours on the road in a beat up old dusty truck going down washboard back trails at 10 to 20 mph. We could not look out window without laying the seat at a 45 degree angle, then no time for game drive, regardless we did not stay in park. 
      Driving between saringett and Ngorongoro he took us down backroads where Afrishare wasted time so he would only pay for one day in crater park fees 
    Promised a full day in Ngorongoro crater we maybe got 3 hours in the bottom as we had to be outside the park by 1 in the afternoon so he did not have to pay park fees.
Afrishare promised a 7 Days safari inside these wonderful parks! He only paid park fees for 4 and a half days, pocketing the remaining entrance fees! We were asked to leave as early as  5 in am to accommodate him saving money on park fees!
Afrishare should not be able to advertise on your website, he gives Africa, it¢®?s wonderful parks, animals  and it¢®?s great people a bad name! 
Shame on him!

David Poussif,US,Visited: November 2016,08-Dec-16,20-35,2-5 safaris,Safari Trackers Adventure,1,Don't book!,"The experience with this tour company was bad since the beginning. The communication by email didn't flow, and I always had to chase up Charles to get more information. 
They offered me a good price for a 4 days camping safari, I accepted and rejected another tour operator (7wonderssafaris) that gave me a cheaper quote, because Charles seemed to have better reviews.
Charles asked me for a deposit a week earlier and the whole payment in cash the day before the safari, which I didn't feel comfortable to give because even the day before I had to chase up after him to communicate and he still didn't know who the guide will be or what time they would pick us up the next day. 
Apparently Charles had another bigger group he would be guiding. This is understandable, but the guide we went with wasn't good. The other tourists complained that he didn't communicate anything with them. I was always talking to the guide and then passing the information to the rest of the tourists.
Even worst, to my surprise, it turned out that this guide was actually from 7WondersSafari !!!
So at the end I paid more to go with the company I rejected because they didn't have good reviews.
The safari itself was good, but the communication and service was deplorable. You can check what we saw herehttps://ubuntutravelblog.wordpress.com/2016/10/07/safari-in-tanzania/"

Hence asking for additional funds . This resulted in us missing the ballon ride experience. The dollar¢®?s we paid with were not fake ( but had been replaced with fake dollars produced in Kenya) hence I would not trust booking with this company . This was a scam !
Dawn Clark,UK,Visited: February 2017,03-Nov-17,35-50,first safari,I love Africa Safaris Ltd,1,Stay well clear of this company and anything associated with the Vimic group.,"This company and the individuals involved are utterly dishonest and disingenuous, and I found out the hard way. After spending a considerable amount of money on this safari (almost double of the others sharing the Jeep) I never got what the safari had been sold as. On more than one occasion I was left with no pre booked accommodation and had to arrange my own. I was told by Victor and Maurin that I would be reimbursed....which has still not happened and this was 2 months ago, the last time I emailed asking the whereabouts of the refund I was told to ¢®¡Æbe patient¢®¡¾. I was a female travelling alone and I was lucky that my travelling companions who I¢®?d met along the way had my best interests at heart and made sure I wasn¢®?t left in a vulnerable situation, which was never something Viktor ever cared about. On one particular night I was driven around different campsites by three men looking for accommodation that could fit me in, after 3 hours in the dark with no food and no toilet stop I eventually was placed in a chalet with no running water or lights. On the  last day, and by now I thought things couldn¢®?t get worse, I was told by the Jeep guide that my park fees had not been paid and so I would have to wait for Viktor to arrive and he would take me himself. Thankfully the other tourists thought this was unacceptable and when Viktor arrived we all insisted that he gave me the money for the park entrance so I could continue with the group. I wouldn¢®?t of left anything or anyone with Viktor as he had proven himself to be an untrustworthy individual and I realized my safety was not something he concerned himself with. So while I ¢®¡Æpatiently¢®¡¾ await my $400 refund I would like to offer my experience as a cautionary tale. Please feel free to ask for more information as I will be happy to help and ensure he is prevented from profiting on his dishonesty."
debra,CA,Visited: October 2018,13-Dec-18,50-65,2-5 safaris,Base Camp Tanzania,2,did not deliver,"We decided to go with Basecamp Tanzania after reading the excellent reviews, in particular, the comments about the guides .... ""incredible"", ""extremely knowledgeable"", ""beyond exceptional"", ""made experience most memorable"", ""walking safaripedia"", ""extremely competent"", ""taught a lot about animal behaviour and ecosystem"", etc. etc. Pretty impressive. Unfortunately our experience was nothing at all like the reviews, extremely disappointing. We got a driver, not a guide, who could barely speak English. Attempts at communicating were frustrating and led to misunderstandings. We drove in silence. He stopped when we asked but often drove off while we were still taking pictures. He provided no information about the animals, the environment, etc. On his advice we changed when we visited the crater because he said morning would be better. It was completely clouded in, no views, to which he said mornings always cloudy?? This company was much more expensive than other tours we looked at but given the reviews thought it would be worth it. Not getting a proper guide, feel we paid too much for an experience that did not deliver what was promised. They had to have known this person spoke little English and was not a proper guide. All we received from the company was an apology. Missed out on a once in a lifetime opportunity."
Debra M,US,Visited: January 2023,08-Mar-23,65+,2-5 safaris,Galloping Safaris,1,"Liar, Cheat, disreputable!  Do not use under any circumstances","DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY.  My husband and I booked through a great agency in Kenya who outsourced the Tanzania portion of our trip to Galloping Safaris.  Walter, the owner, is a liar and a cheat.  Read other reviews (wish we'd seen them in advance).  We were in Tanzania for 5 days.  He hired a 3rd party guide/driver for us, Athman was EXCELLENT.  He saved the tour for us.  However, Galloping Safaris (GS) had  us pay our entry fee into the Serengeti park (even though we'd paid everything in advance).  He said he was installing a new payment system and was having problems.  We put the $642 USD on our credit card, assuming Walter would do as he said and pay us back when we finished the trip in Arusha.  Walter with GS outright lied to us.  We wasted an hour waiting for him to respond so we could even enter the park.  Next, as we were exiting Ngorogoro crater, we were not allowed to leave the park since GS (Walter) had not paid the concession fee of approximately $100 USD.  Our driver, Athman, convinced Walter to go to the bank to immediately transfer the $$.  Another hour wasted there.  Then we arrived at Tarangire Park, only to find out, once again, Walter at GS had not paid the entry fees.  He then asked us again to pay $227 USD of our own $$.  We had no choice but to pay, because where else would we go?  Yup, another hour wasted sorting this out.  Upon our final day, we drove back to Arusha, met with Walter, his wife Glory (a Director of the company) and someone who said they were his lawyer.  He did not have the money to pay us back upon our arrival ($869 USD total), instead he wrote and signed what we thought was a legitimate legal agreement that he would wire us the money in 2 weeks.  That date came and went, no $$$, more lies from Walter and now zero response from him. He should not be allowed to operate.  DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY under any circumstances."
Dee Johnson,SE,Visited: January 2021,31-Mar-21,35-50,over 5 safaris,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,1,AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!,"With this I am expressing my deepest disappointment regarding the 3-Day tour we received from Karibu Safaris in Kenya. 
The communication with Robert and the tour planning was ok, I have no complaint about that.
The problem is the way the tour was guided and the attitude from the driver and tour guide HAMISI, it was a very strong disappointment and even humiliation towards us as visitors and customers.

- no drinking water for the guests. When I asked about the water, the tour guide HAMISI said ""sorry, I forgot"". But at the same time he had drinking water, even several bottles!!!, at the game drive and was drinking himself and keeping them in the cooler box. That was very very much humiliating. Very unprofessional conduct. Phaawww!

- on the 3rd day's morning we were supposed to have a game drive in Amboseli park till 10am in the morning (that was confirmed beforehand by Robert - the organiser), but we left the park at 8:40 already with no reason. So the driver cut us the pleasure of experiencing the park by one half (50%), as we spent there only about one and a half hours (90 minutes). Another hour and 20 minutes were stolen. It's a huge disappointment. Robbery!!!

- the choice of the roads. In order to maybe make a small fuel economy (6 to 10$), the driver chose rural roads that in parts were hardly passable and full of dust, all our clothes, bags, hair, bodies and electronic equipment was in dirt and dust. The driver, willing to save a few hundreds of shillings, was driving the roads that are no good for safari tours. We did not meet a single other Safari tour operator's vehicle while taking the rural roads, while there were many of them on paved roads. So the point is that the unprofessional driver/tour guide deliberately chose bad roads just to make some ""shortcut"" meanwhile breaking the company's vehicle and disappointing the customers that were on a private tour. That is soooo STUPID!!!!  We made a remark on that before our return on which driver HAMISI only laughed at us - straight into our faces... Very very humiliating!!!  Guys avoid this scam of an operator!!!

There are some more problems and negative remarks that I should point out like a lack of explanation about the parks, surroundings, eco-system, animals, history, etc.; - instead the driver is chatting by sending texts on his smartphone...

- the vehicle arrived to pick us up dusty and dirty inside (from outside was ok) - it's just a proof of to what extent this company is unprofessional and do not consider the comfort and needs of their customers. I have experienced over six different tours in Tanzania and Kenya and I can compare the services received by this incompetent company with others. 
This operator should be AVOIDED!!!

I need to express that I deeply regret having chosen this company's services and I have to warn other visitors and possible clients to AVOID tours given by Karibu Safaris in Kenya.

AVOID!   AVOID!   AVOID!"

The first week in Kenya went well, but with quite a few issues in the plan, that always got sorted out thanks to our driver.

From day 8 they just let us down, the driver informed us that the boss Mr. Otieno had left with the money and all employees and clients were left with no bookings, no money and no info... We basically had to pay the rest of the trip ourselves. When going to the police station they informed us that many other groups of tourists had filed a report against the company for the same reasons. We then got informed that Otieno got arrested and is now under investigation. We have not yet gotten our money back, and waiting for more news on what is happening next. 

KWSS was a successful business, all it took to ruin this was a BAD and selfish person. The employees lost their jobs (and God knows that jobs are gold in Africa) and certainly some lives got ruined, all this for a few $$$... Shame."
Den,DK,Visited: October 2019,16-Oct-19,35-50,over 5 safaris,Enrico¢®?s Tours and Safaris,1,Do not use! The worst experience ever!,"I booked a 7 day tour with Enrico safari two months in advance, and emailed him a few days before arriving to ensure that everything was organized, which he confirmed. However, the service level and organization of this company turned out to be far from professional or satisfactory. Here is a long list of reasons:
- My tour was supposed to start with an airport pick-up from where we would go straight to Etosha NP, but there was no one to meet me at the airport. Only through the help of a random friendly taxi driver did I manage to get a hold of Enrico. After two hours someone finally arrived, but this was not the guide/driver who was originally meant to do the tour. That guide had not shown up as it turned out - my new guide informed me. We ended up leaving with a 3-hour delay out of Windhoek as the new guide had to drive around and arrange different private things before leaving.
- Whereas the other guides waiting for their clients at the airport were well dressed wearing uniforms with the company logos, my guide was shabbily dressed in dirty clothes and flip flops.
- As a result of the delay in leaving from Windhoek we arrived very late in Etosha and I did not get the afternoon game drive that I had paid for. No apology or compensation offered!
- The guide did not know the itinerary of my tour and did not have it either on his phone or on paper, so basically he did not know what I was doing, where I was staying, etc. And Enrico did nothing to ensure that he did. Even on day 3 of the tour the guide was unsure about what was happening after having been on the phone with Enrico several times.
- All trough this it was very difficult to get a hold of Enrico, who had claimed to the guide that I had not given him the flight information even though I have an email saying ¢®¡Æthank you for providing the information¢®¡¾. He also repeatedly kept saying he would call to sort things out with me, but he never did.
- When arriving at the lodge in Etosha on the first night I found out that the booking was wrong as only two nights had been booked, but according to the itinerary I was staying for 3. Enrico said he would fix it Friday night, but it did not get fixed until Sunday afternoon. And I had to go to a different accommodation.
- On the second day we went on a game drive in the park, but when it came to paying the park fees the guide didn¢®?t have any money to pay as there was no money on the company card. (Enrico later claimed that there were problems with the card, but if you read other reviews here, this is apparently not the first time that has happened). After waiting for over 2 hours at the park office, and the park was closing we paid the park fees ourselves even though they had already been paid for as part of the payment for the tour. We would not have been able to leave the park otherwise and would have had nowhere to stay. During those more than two hours we tried to call Enrico repeatedly, but he did not answer. In the evening we finally spoke to him. He was extremely rude and could not see any problem and denied the problems. He said he would call us back later but never did.
- On the third day the guide was changed to another guide without any notice. On the same day we were stopped by the police and rangers in the National park. The guide did not have the required documents to prove that he was a guide, so was not actually allowed to drive in the park with me. The police let him continue with a warning.
- The guides/drivers of other companies would use part of the lunch breaks in the park to refuel and clean the car in order to maximize the clients¢®? time, whereas my guide would get me in the  car and then spend 15 min refueling and cleaning the car.
- All the other companies used appropriate safari vehicles, whereas Enrico used a normal car used for normal roads. During the two days I was there not once did I see any company or private visitors to the park use such a car. The car was not appropriate for safaris and at the end of the day both back tires were flat.
- A lot of the information in the itinerary was wrong. E.g. it said that the drive from Etosha to Sawkopmund was 3 hours, but it was 6 1/2 hours. The pictures and description (¢®¡Æperched on a hill with expansive views¢®¡¾) used were not from Etosha Safari Lodge, but from a more expensive lodge.
- On day 4 I spoke to Enrico on the phone as the guide was trying to get money to pay for activities, petrol and accommodation, but Enrico kept not transferring enough money even though the guide pushed for it. Enrico practices a system where the guide has a company card, onto which he transfers money for the next thing - next meal, next accommodation, next activity. But sometimes the card doesn¢®?t work and often there isn¢®?t enough money on the card to e.g. fill up the petrol. Enrico was extremely rude to me over the phone, yelled, lied, talked over me, refused to listen to anything I said and was very arrogant. I have never by any of the tour companies I have used in any of the 60 countries I have visited been spoken to so rudely and been treated so unprofessionally.
- On day 5 when my activities had been moved to (according to the itinerary they were supposed to have been on day 4) I arranged with the guide to be picked up at 9, so that I could be at the activity center for 10. At 9.40 when he still hadn¢®?t arrived, I called him, and he said that he was at the garage to have the tires fixed, which got broken in Etosha 2 days prior. He showed up at 10.15!
- On day 5 the car had to be changed as it was not appropriate for driving in the desert in Sesriem, and an appropriate car was to be driven from Windhoek. The day before Enrico had said on the phone that the car would be ready at 11.00. At 13.45 when I had finished my activity there was still no car, and Enrico now informs the guide over the phone that the car was in service. Again no apology or compensation.
- We set off for Sesriem in the car that was not appropriate for the desert and after driving for 10 min the car would not run. As I found out 15 min later, the guide had not put any petrol on the car. So we simply ran out of petrol in the middle of the road in swakopmund. At this point I decided to terminate the tour, as I did not feel safe in the car or with the guide or the company.

In sum, the tour was a complete mess organisationwise from beginning to the point when I¢®?d had enough. This caused a lot of stress, hassle and a feeling of not feeling safe. Constantly having to worry about whether the guide could pay for petrol the next time, or whether the next thing on the itinerary had been booked or not, is not exactly something that makes a holiday enjoyable or relaxing. Throughout the duration of the tour Enrico acted both rudely and highly unprofessionally. E.g. shouting on the phone, not listening, not acknowledging that anything was wrong (judge yourself by the points listed above), not answering or returning calls, despite making many promises to do so. In spite of all the disorganization, no apologies or compensation were offered. On the contrary Enrico accused me of looking for things to criticize (judge for yourself by the points above - and reviews listing the exact same problems). I completely recognize the descriptions in the bad reviews that many other travelers on here have written and there is definitely a pattern of the same things happening repeatedly. So if you value your holiday, time and money, do not use Enrico! I met many professional companies along the way in Namibia - use them instead!"

Derek,US,Visited: February 2020,02-Mar-20,35-50,first safari,Tanzania Mwangaza Safari,2,Poor experience,"Never in my life have I written a negative review, so I honestly feel bad about this post.  However, if I were a potential customer of Tanzania Mwangaza Safari, I would want to know this information.   

I was volunteering at a hospital in Dar es Salaam for a few weeks and decided to splurge on a safari at the end of my trip.  I chose this safari company because they were affordable ($1450 USD) and offered a 4 day/ 3 night trip that fit my time constraints.  The communication and payments prior to the trip were excellent.  Turns out that nobody else signed up for this particular trip so it ended up being just myself and the driver.  
Day 1 -  Departed right on time and the day went completely as expected on route to Selous.  We did get delayed for 1.5 hour behind multiple trucks stuck in the mud and blocking the road, but that just goes with the territory of travel.  Went on an evening boat trip with another group, with a French speaking guide, but he was nice enough to offer some info in English to me.  
Day 2 - Driver showed up 1 hour late then had me wait while he went to the restaurant and ate breakfast.   We then drove to Selous entrance gate where we waited another 1.5 hour for him to locate a guide for the day.  I watched in envy as dozens of others tourists arrived in plane and jeep and went on safari while we sat on the side of the road waiting for the guide to arrive from the neighboring village.  I just chalked it up to inconveniences associated with a budget minded safari.  Other than that, it was a great day in the park with many animals seen.
Day 3 - Driver showed up 1 hour late again.  The day was supposed to be a sort of game drive on our way through Selous park on our way to an afternoon game drive in Mikumi park.  The driver told me he needed to drive quickly so he would not incur additional park fees.  As a result, absolutely zero wildlife viewing happened as we drove at 70 kph through Selous.   I thought the vehicle might completely come apart as we sped along the rough roads. We ended up with three flat tires we throughout that day.  The spare tire and jack were not suited for the fixes so the driver and I spent hours that day collecting stones in the brush, crawling in the mud under the jeep to precariously prop up the vehicle, and stopping at a roadside tire shop.  I am amazed that one of us did not get seriously injured they way we were forced to rig the jeep for the tire changes as the jack and stones repeatedly did not hold thus dropping the vehicle violently back to the ground.  It took us 14.5 hours to make it to Mikumi that day so our planned afternoon safari definitely did not take place.   It is a budget trip and all part of the adventure, right?
Day 4 - We made plans to go on a half day game drive in Mikumi prior to our drive back to Dar.  Unfortunately, the driver showed up 2 hours late that day and was unreachable by phone.  Mikumi was beautiful , but we only had two hours in the park before we had to make the 8.5 hr (normally much quicker, but we had to drive slowly because of the tires) trip back to the city.

I realize I am incredibly fortunate just to have the opportunity to go on safari in Tanzania.  Perhaps my expectations were far too high for a budget safari.  Looking at their current reviews, it appears I am one of the only customers to have a less than optimal experience with Mwangaza so take this negative review with a grain of salt.   However, when I look back and realize we spent 31 hours driving, 8 hours waiting for the driver and fixing flat tires for only 8 hours of actual safari related time, I feel this trip was far from worthwhile in terms of time and cost.

In summary, even though the people at Mwangaza were very nice, I personally had a very poor experience with them.

Desiree,BR,Visited: March 2017,07-Mar-17,35-50,over 5 safaris,Bramwel Safaris | Tanzania,1,Warning complete fraud and nightmare safari,"Complete fraud and nightmare safari:

I am a researcher who has been living in Tanzania since 2014. I have booked several safaris with different agents since 2007. I warn you never to book a safari with Bramwel Safaris, owned by William Amon in Arusha Tanzania, because he is a sincere fraudster and criminal. We booked the safari with Bramwel as he got recommended to us by a friend (expat living in Tanzania, working for a foreign embassy) who thought to know William Amon well, also he was shocked after hearing what happened to us and tried to pressure William to give us our money back. We wanted to support a local Tanzanian small safari agent, but after this experience sadly have to admit that next time we will book again with a big one like Leopard Tours as we never had problems with them. So William Amon¢®?s business practices also will have a negative impact on all the other small local Safari agents in Tanzania as he spoils the reputation of them all. 

So here is what happened to us when we booked a safari with him last October 2016. After getting in contact with William via email, we arranged our safari program and then paid 1450USD per person, so 4350USD in total,  in advance for a 5 days safari (Ngorongoro and Serengeti) for 3 people in a 3-beds room. After we arrived early in the morning at Kilimanjaro International airport we first had to wait about an hour until the driver arrived at the airport. He said he had a flat tyre on the way to the airport. The car was a very small (not a safari vehicle) car in a very bad condition, with barely any space for the luggage, and about to break down every moment. We arrived after a 3 hours drive at our hotel Meru hotel Lekisilai a bit outside of Arusha as the car was only able to drive very slowly and the driver had to call William and the hotel several times as he did not know the way to the hotel. Usually it takes only 1 hour from the airport to Arusha town. The next day we expected the driver to pick us from the hotel at 9a.m., as whe had arranged via phone with William on the day of arrival. But the driver turned up only at around 10a.m. He also did not come inside the hotel to greet us and tell us that he is here. He also did not make a very friendly and reputable impression, rather looking as having a night of weed smoking behind. No we had to go outside and tell him that we are ready. 

So then we drove to Ngorongoro where it was planned to stay for 2 nights at Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge. It was planned that we would stay the afternoon at the lodge to relax and then have a full day game drive the next day in the crater. To our surprise when we arrived on the crater rim the driver did not drive to the lodge but drove into the crater as he told us that he thought we had an afternoon game drive as well. Well at that point we accepted as we were sure we¢®?ll get our full day game drive the next day as well.  So we drove around in the crater for about 2 hours. But to our suprise we were getting late, I knew gates close at 6p.m. and by that time you are not allowed to be in the crater anymore, however our driver was asserting that it was 6.30, saying they won¢®?t say anything and that they say it¢®?s 6p.m. just to be sure people are out on time. So when we arrived at the gate it was closed, no ranger there anymore. The driver was honking but noone there. So he had to call the park rangers to send someone to open the gate.  About 45 minutes later a ranger turned up and opened. He was very angry and we felt very insecure. The driver had to pay a fine of 50USD that was clear. Then we drove to the lodge. To our surprise when we arrived at the lodge they said there is no reservation of a hotel room for us and that there was no payment received for 2 nights at the lodge. And that they only have a free room for 1 night but we would need to pay for it directly at the hotel. But we already had paid for all the costs (car, driver, hotels, park fees etc. in advance to William). So I called William to ask what is happening and then he asked me if I can help him and pay the hotel as apparently his cashier went on holiday and he realized now that he did not make any hotel reservations and did not pay any hotels but ran away with the money. I refused, and William assured that he¢®?ll find a solution to transfer the money until the next day. However the next day we were kept hostages the whole day at the hotel because they did not let us go anywehere until they received the money from William. After a full day of waiting and making phone calls, instead of our paid full day game drive in the crater that we lost,  we were released at around 4:30p.m. as the money was transferred. As there was no space at Sopa lodge we had to find another hotel. William arranged a room for a night outside Ngorongoro Conservation Area in Karatu at the Karatu country lodge, which was actually not the standard we booked and payed for, this is rather a 2 stars hotel and not  4 stars like Sopa lodge. Also it is outside the park, and we had to hurry again to be outside the gate on time again. Well the next day same story, the hotel was not paid and our driver said his credit card that was supposed to be filled with money by William was not filled and was left with around 20¢®?000Tsh (around 10USD). Well then William said he¢®?ll send someone with a cheque. Meanwhile he ensured he¢®?ll go to the bank and fill the card with money while we were waiting. But then we had to wait again for about 4 hours until around 12 o¢®?clock until that cheque arrived, it came from Arusha. Keep in mind we were supposed to be at Serengeti the same day, which is about a 4 to 5 hours drive from Ngorongoro Gate. But next shock, the name of the hotel on the cheque was wrong, it said Karatu lodge instead of Karatu country lodge and the hotel manager refused to accept the cheque of 200USD because of that as he said there is another lodge in Karatu with that name. So trying to safe our safari I said I will pay these 200USD so that we could go, as one of my friends came to Tanzania for the first time and maybe never will have the chance to see Serengeti again. I called William, complained, told him that I don¢®?t accept all this, etc. and said that I don¢®?t want to arrive at Serengeti gate without having the entrance fee etc. paid, so he needs to assure me there will be money on the card. Also I said I guess Serengeti Sopa lodge is also not booked. William said yes, not booked but he said the hotel is no problem. He has another hotel than Sopa and gave a name, and said this hotel he knows well, he often brings customers there, he can just call and we¢®?ll have a room (respectively a tent,it is a tented camp), so they also give him credit, he can book on credit, he asked if we are ok with that hotel, we said yes. So William ensured that this problem will not happen again, and that he is not going to loose his face again and that I can be sure that there will be money on the card when we arrive there (at Serengeti park you only can pay with credit card, tour agents usually have that card called tembo card, it¢®?s a kind of credit card). So I thought ok, he can¢®?t be that brash, and hoped he will not cheat again, having in mind my friend who came from Switzerland for seeing the Serengeti. But keep in mind  William let us depart from Arusha, knowing there is no money on the card. So he was completely aware of that there is no money to pay, and speculated that once we were at the gates and hotels we anyway are going to pay as we didn¢®?t want to return or could not cause it was too late. 

So we departed, had to pay a transfer fee again at Ngorongoro gate, even though the driver told us he had paid the day before for 2 days but once you go outside this ticket becomes invalid. We waited there another half an hour as we had to wait for a number from William we had to give to the Ngorongoro administration. Finally we arrived at Serengeti gate at around 4:30p.m., remember you have to be at the hotel by 6p.m., not allowed to drive around in the park after 6p.m. But when we arrived at the gate, no money on the credit card, the driver started to be angry, told us he can¢®?t understand that, he called William telling him he cannot treat his customers like that. I tried to call William and he did not pick up several times. I refused to pay. Waited. Did not trust about the hotel anymore as well. Finally the driver gave me the number of a friend of William of whom the driver said he is helping William sometimes with the business. So I called him,complained, said I am not going to pay, but we had in the end no other possibility than to pay and enter, as there is nowhere else you can go, no hotels outside the gate respectively between Ngorongoro and Serengeti, 5 hours back to Ngorongoro and it was 4.30p.m., you have to be outside the gates at 6p.m. So no chance. The friend of William apologized and said he¢®?ll do his best. I asked about the hotel. Meanwhile the hotel had changed as well. He said we are going to Ang¢®?ata Camps now instead, which was another hotel than the one he told me we are going when we were in Karatu. So I said now I am going to call the hotel to ask if that hotel was paid before I am going to pay the entrance fee. The hotel then confirmed the payment. But I had to pay the park fees for all us people plus for the car, plus Ang¢®?ata Camps is a special campsite with extra fees. I just paid for 1 night which was around 400USD, hoping that there will be money on the card the other day. But the other day still no money arrived. So the next day had to go to the gate again and pay another around 400USD. So total around more than 800USD we had to pay again, even though we had paid for it already in Switzerland (2 nights were planned at Sopa lodge) to William, so we paid double now. But we had to, no chance to go back. So what he did, he let us drive from Karatu to Serengeti ensuring me that there will be money on the card, but there was no money, so he let us drive there completely aware of that we will need to pay ourselves on arrival as no chance to go anywhere. How bash is this. We thought it cannot become worse when we were in Karatu but it came worse. Can you imagine, what kind of person you must be if you do this to other persons, completely without moral, conscience and just criminal. He just let us drive there, he set a snare for us. Then after the 2 days in Serengeti we drove back to Arusha. At Ngorongoro Conservation Area Gate the driver asked me to give him another 30USD as he told me there is another fine/fee to pay.

 We told William we will meet him in Arusha at around 5p.m.. He is so bash he said 5p.m. is ok, but from 6p.m. to  10p.m. he has a church meeting and no time. He is a pentecoastal and pretends to be a very religious person. Imagine he is owing people money, has fucked up the Safari of people coming from far away, paying a lot of money and then you have the gall to say I have a church meeting then and only time at 5p.m.  So because the drive from Serengeti back to Arusha is long and Tanzanian roads are unpredictable, we were not on time, and William sent me the message that he has left Arusha hotel already for the church meeting. So I decided to go directly to his church. The driver knew where it was. So we went there. William came out, appologized and asked us what we want. We told him the sum we thought would be appropriate, which was 1200USD which was very very very kind, we could have asked much much more,not only the money back that we paid double, the 1 day we lost at Ngorongoro, but also for the stress and trouble. We said he can also pay the rest in a voucher that I maybe can use when I go to Zanzibar, as I live in Tanzania. He agreed, but said at the moment he has only 600USD available. He gave us the 600USD and said the rest he¢®?ll pay in November 2016 as he¢®?ll waiting to receive a credit from the bank then. He said otherwise he would need to tale themoney fromhis own bank account. We said well we also had to take the money from our own bank account and you are the business owner, so it¢®?s anyway your account. I mean how can you come to the idea to argue like this. He also said he¢®?ll write a written contract/agreement about the sum he owes as well as a voucher. Until now we have wheter received the money nor a written agreement/contract nor a voucher. In November I called, wrote email etc.- nothing. I said ok I give you a last chance until December, end of the year, if I don¢®?t receive anything, I¢®?ll going to make it public and will write to the Tanzania Tourism Board, Tanzania Investment Centre, etc. as well as on diverse travel forums. Then he said in December he is going to receive a credit from a friend in the US and he¢®?ll pay then, saying that we are an absolute priority. Then on 31.12 I got this email?Business have been very, very difficult, and I real feel bad. I am kindly asking you to give me extension and propose a way to pay by installments?¢®¡Æ. I agreed for a last time and got this answer?We start getting bookings for this year, and I am checking my markups, I think I can be able to pay twice, 16th Feb 1st instalment and end of Feb second instalment, Let me know you are okay with this, I am so so sorry for all the ups and down I have caused!¢®¡Æ. Until now nothing. The last email I got when I asked about the money mid of february was?Thanks,This is real a priority, wish me lucky.¢®¡Æ So time is over, I don¢®?t let him fool us any further. We will also take legal measures. We were more than kind, understandable and had hope until today, but this guy really thinks we are idiots, and speculates that at some point we will give up or forget. I could somehow see it in his eyes when we met that he thought ?now I got away very easily¢®¡Æ, I also think he thought he could treat us like this because we are women. Thought wrong! Now I think I should have asked all the money directly when we met and don¢®?t make concessions and compromise. He never had the intention to pay back, it was a fraud from the beginning. So never book with him. 


Complete fraud and nightmare safari:

I am a researcher who has been living in Tanzania since 2014. I have booked several safaris with different agents since 2007. I warn you never to book a safari with Bramwel Safaris, owned by William Amon in Arusha Tanzania, because he is a sincere fraudster and criminal. We booked the safari with Bramwel as he got recommended to us by a friend (expat living in Tanzania, working for a foreign embassy) who thought to know William Amon well, also he was shocked after hearing what happened to us and tried to pressure William to give us our money back. We wanted to support a local Tanzanian small safari agent, but after this experience sadly have to admit that next time we will book again with a big one like Leopard Tours as we never had problems with them. So William Amon¢®?s business practices also will have a negative impact on all the other small local Safari agents in Tanzania as he spoils the reputation of them all. 

So here is what happened to us when we booked a safari with him last October 2016. After getting in contact with William via email, we arranged our safari program and then paid 1450USD per person, so 4350USD in total,  in advance for a 5 days safari (Ngorongoro and Serengeti) for 3 people in a 3-beds room. After we arrived early in the morning at Kilimanjaro International airport we first had to wait about an hour until the driver arrived at the airport. He said he had a flat tyre on the way to the airport. The car was a very small (not a safari vehicle) car in a very bad condition, with barely any space for the luggage, and about to break down every moment. We arrived after a 3 hours drive at our hotel Meru hotel Lekisilai a bit outside of Arusha as the car was only able to drive very slowly and the driver had to call William and the hotel several times as he did not know the way to the hotel. Usually it takes only 1 hour from the airport to Arusha town. The next day we expected the driver to pick us from the hotel at 9a.m., as whe had arranged via phone with William on the day of arrival.

Diana,US,Visited: June 2019,14-Jul-19,65+,first safari,Trip Advisor Africa Safaris,1,Misleading and bait and switch,"A group of people went to Kenya and Tanzania from June 24th through July 10th, 2019.  The majority of time was spent in Kenya.  We had used TripAdvisor African Safaris agent Seth Vincent  to arrange for the Kenya portion of the trip.  During the booking period, we received several itineraries outlining the accommodation and numbers of rooms we requested to accommodate our party.  Although we had received confirming emails outlining where we would be staying and the number of rooms booked, on at least two occasions the number of rooms were shorted, forcing people to double up although people had paid additional money for separate rooms.  We can only assume that Seth pocketed the difference himself.  We had been promised a lovely place in Arusha, Tanzania at the Mount Meru Hotel.  However, Seth had emailed our subcontracted drivers and had them book us into a very poor hotel in a rough area of Arusha.  We called the hotel on our approved itinerary and they had no record of any reservation for us.  Again, I suspect that Seth deliberately did a bait and switch that probably allowed him to pocket the difference while putting the 14 of us in a very poor hotel.  This was the last night he was responsible for so we really had no recourse.  We cannot prove that this was deliberate on his part but he would not return any calls at that point.  
The bottom line is DO NOT use this person for your safari experience.  Do go with a firm that has  lengthy track record and positive reviews."
Didier,FR,Visited: September 2023,02-Oct-23,65+,2-5 safaris,Biwakwango,1,Biwakwango with Kgato Safaris 1/5: To be avoided. Prices top of the lines for services down of range,"Biwakwango associated with Kgato Safaris 1/5: To be avoided. Prices top of the lines for services down of the range, or even much less!

Namibia part, rather poor, ensured by Thierry Pagnot, owner of Biwakwango. Very old vehicle without any comfort (rough suspensions, no air conditioning and no comfort equipment available in the fleet of other 4x4s such as refrigerators, chargers, etc.). Very ordinary animal guide (by far the worst on the 4 safaris experienced previously) and does what he wants without taking into account our wishes (we completely missed sites like Swakopmund, according to the people we met at the end of travel). In addition, he is someone who saves money on everything, hence the daily hungry and tasteless picnics, bottled water distributed by droppers (we had to buy it several times) and a problem of Accommodation over the 3 days at Ngepi camp for which we had to fight to get something decent. Other accommodations in Namibia were OK.
But the worst by far was the Botswana part which he subcontracted to a structure with which he is used to working, Kgato safaris run by a pastor named BK. It was truly a nightmare. 4x4 with trailer out of breath, overloaded and with worn tires. On the vehicle side, 3 predictable punctures with, for the first on the 1st day, the need for a repairer waited more than 1 hour because there was no jack in the 4x4. Several getting stuck in the sand with our help to collect branches of tree to put under the tires (no sand removal plate) and to push and even once to transport luggage and equipment a few hundred meters to reach the camp, the 4x4 being in waiting for other vehicles to be towed and get out of this mess (safari on evening canceled due to the late arrival and our tiredness. A fire started in our feet due to the faulty power supply in a fridge and which could have ended very badly. An engine overheated several times which required several stops, culminating in the explosion of the radiator which put an end, before the end, to our journey with this unprofessional structure, to say the least, that is Kgato Safaris and its boss BK. After hours of waiting in full sun (40¢®¨¡ in the shade), we were rescued by Tony from Tony Mobile Safaris who we can never thank enough for getting us out of this bad situation and who led us to Kasane is 3 hours of slopes away, despite the 3 clients he was transporting who were kind enough to accept that we join their team. Not from Chobe River but finally extracted from this hell.
The only positive point is that the cook and BK's aide-de-camp, very friendly and always smiling, did their best to make our stay a little less stressful (in particular, the food was very good). Note that the so-called purified water was in fact that of the self-service tap at the entrance to each reserve via a large plastic pipe lying on the ground (another lie from BK).
But the worst part of all that is not there. We could have accepted all these hazards tinged with amateurism if at least we had been able to explore the Okavango Delta as we dreamed of since it was the essential reason for this expensive trip. Instead, to save money, BK and his Kgato Safaris have set up their camps outside areas of interest. For example, for the Moremi Game Reserve, they set up camp for us at Xini Lagoon, more than 20 km of track from the Moremi area indicated on the ¢®¡ÆTracks 4 Africa¢®¡¾ map. The place was dry and uninteresting while the photos and videos taken by Tony Mobile Safaris clients testified to this magical place that we completely missed. Same for Khwai and Savuti. I didn't take any photos during certain safaris as the areas explored were so uninteresting.

We therefore completely missed out on our trip, particularly in the Okavango, and this, mainly because of Thierry Pagnot from Biwakwango who bears full responsibility for organizing this entire awful trip.

Dileep Kumar Reddy,AE,Visited: August 2018,12-Sep-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Magical Retreats & Adventures Tours,2,Very disappointed,In view of the increasing popularity of online reviews I decided to go with magical retreat safaris. I cannot convey how disgusting experience we had on those 10 days. Hotels were not good and the driver (Anthony) one of the laziest I have ever seen in my life. Didn¢®?t go by the itinerary And he picked us at around 9AM for a early morning game drive
Disappointed,UK,Visited: September 2017,07-Dec-17,20-35,over 5 safaris,Safarihub,1,"Complete rip off - terrible guide, horrible experience and now they won't respond to or refund us","Before we arrived in the country Safarihub were very attentive, but once we arrived in country the airport pick up was the only thing that met our expectations (or the promises made on their website). I have no idea how they have any good reviews as all the information about their 'fleet' of cars was untrue - we were in an old, noisy, uncomfortable vehicle with another company's logo on it. We also had the worst safari guide I have ever come across. I've been on about 9 safaris now in 5 different countries (including previously in Tanzania) and I have never had such a terrible experience - this guide couldn't even see! I actually think he was losing his sight. He wasn't able to spot any animals. The animals we spotted he scared away by driving fast straight at them. (Ironic as the majority of the time he drove unbelievably slowly so we didn't cover much ground). He had no radio contact with anyone so had no colleagues giving him information on where the leopords etc. were. I was apalled. When I confronted safarihub about it they admitted that he worked for another company (not their driver) and they'd never done any check of whether he was a good guide or not. Despite being very apologetic at first though, Safarihub stopped replying to us and now we are desperately trying to get any of our money back having spent thousands of pounds on a really disappointing safari. This was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime for us, but ended up full of stress and anger because of Safarihub. Steer well clear of these thieves.

Disappointed customer,UK,Visited: December 2013,29-Jan-14,20-35,2-5 safaris,Terminal Tours Kenya,2,Bad experience with Terminal Tours,"My friend and I signed up for a 3-day Masai Mara tour with Terminal Tours (Kenya).

Terminal Tours arranged for us to stay in Rhino Camp for 2 nights, which turned out to be quite a bad experience. Firstly, the electricity was unavailable during some parts of the promised hours and hot showers (generated by wood fire) were mostly unavailable during the promised hours too.

Our driver (and guide) Sammy does not seem enthusiastic in leading the tour. He was often quiet during the game drive and only spoke when people in the tour group asked him questions. Furthermore, he seemed clueless to some of our questions, to the extent that two of the Canadians in our group sarcastically told him to ""at least make up a reason to tell us when we ask you again"".

Also, the apparent owner of Terminal Tours - Nelson, practices price differentiation to a huge extent. For example, people on the same tour were charged in varying amounts between USD$360 and USD400+."
Dolores,FR,Visited: September 2023,21-Oct-23,50-65,first safari,Tanganyika Outdoor Safari & Adventure,1,Run away Tanganyika,"The two of us went privately to Tanzania for a 7-day safari with Tanganyika which had been chosen by our travel agency in France Marco Vasco. We complained about having a vehicle over 20 years old with windows and doors that no longer opened, a guide constantly preoccupied with his phone, and Tanganyika explained that the vehicle was perfect for a safari and to explain the malfunction of the vehicle, it was our fault who had broken the mechanism, and disputed our statements. What we noticed, however, was that our vehicle was the oldest of all the other vehicles we encountered on safari. In short, don't believe this safari organizer when he tells you that the vehicles are recent and perfectly in working order, this is not the case, and the chosen guides are more concerned with their phones than explaining wildlife to you.

Dominic,DE,Visited: June 2021,14-Oct-21,20-35,first safari,Taste Of Afrika Safaris,1,!!!WARNING FROM SEKA GONDWE (owner of Taste of Afrika)!!!,"!!!WARNING FROM SEKA GONDWE (owner of Taste of Afrika)!!!

1.)	FAKE REVIEWS!
Seka writes fake reviews himself under alias names!  I know it 100% and I can even prove it, because the Google rating of the user ""lil-emky"" includes the pictures shot by me! I only provided these photos to Seka so he could create a video of our hike for extra payment. NOBODY except seka and me is in possession of these pictures. SO SEKA MUST HAVE WRITTEN THE RATING HIMSELF! I explicitly told Seka to delete the photos after creating the video and not to use them elsewhere. 
When I look at the reviews so also noticed that very many positive reviews were written by users who have only written a single review... funny that people specially create a new Google account to write a single review or...? (but can also be a coincidence)

2.)	SERVICE NOT PROVIDED, PROMISES REFUND FOR MONTHS, BUT DOES NOT REFUND!
We had booked some extras for additional payment. One of these extras did not take place and it does not matter what reason Seka comes up with all of a sudden for the failure of the extra. It's annoying enough when something you were looking forward to doesn't happen, but for Seka not to refund the extra cost is FRAUD! He has been promising me reimbursement since June and postponing it until the following week every time...SINCE JUNE, for 4 months!!!! By now I know I will not get the money back.

3.)	His employees are not salaried, but are contracted as ""self-employed"".
He does not discuss what has been agreed with the customer with the ""employees"", so they get into difficult and unpleasant situations with the customer. 

4.)	He tries to save money even during the tours: e.g. booked beverage flats are suddenly to be paid by the customer (only clarified after discussions).

(supposedly) positive:

5.)	At the beginning (online booking) and when you talk to him (Seka) personally on site, he always seemed very friendly and customer-oriented. He planned our tour according to our wishes and took a lot of time. However, the moment he got the money transferred, the contact already became less. 
I think we were very lucky. Probably the special occasion of our trip - which Seka knew about - led to the fact that Seka didn't cheat us completely and that our trip was carried out at least to a large extent as planned. (Cheaters apparently sometimes still have a bit of heart!).

6.)	What was really SUPER were the super dedicated staff (=self-employed) of our crew during the ascent of Kili (including Nickson and Brison + all porters) as well as our safari-guide Moses! Thank you for giving us a beautiful and successful climb as well as a unique safari despite the problems with Seka! 
Without these people our tour at Taste of Africa would probably have been a total failure. 

Conclusion: Taste of Africa and especially the owner Seka Gondwe are NOT TO RECOMMEND! Seka only wants the customers' money. We were lucky in our misfortune, but other reviews show that this is unfortunately not the case with everyone.

Dorian,DE,Visited: December 2016,20-Dec-16,35-50,2-5 safaris,Ancient Wild Safaris,1,Our private safari was ruined due to the incompetence of this company!,"I booked a private 3-day safari in Amboseli National Park with a friend at the end of November. I spent six months arranging all the details of the safari via email with Michael, the owner of Ancient Wild Safaris. This was my fourth safari, so I was very clear about the services we wanted. 

I was coming from Tanzania and met my friend Sergio and the driver Joseph at the Namanga border.  15 minutes on the road to Amboseli the car broke down.  The driver was clueless how to fix the problem and didn't communicate any information to us.  We waited for two hours on the dirt road until a taxi arrived to take us to the entrance gate of Amboseli, an hour away.  The driver, Joseph stayed with the broken down car. Once at the park entrance, we waited another hour for a van to take us on our first ""game drive"".  We booked a private safari, but were forced to join a Danish couple's tour.  This game drive was really just driving across the park to our hotel, on the opposite side.

I contacted Michael several times during the first day, but he never communicated to me what the plan was for the next day.  Eventually, Joseph told us that we would join the Danish couple's safari again the next morning.  This became our second group game drive during the trip.  Also, it was not our driver or tour company, so we had no choice in what we visited or where we stopped or for how long.  We were just along for the ride.

After the morning game drive, we were dropped off at our hotel with no driver and no car. I had originally arranged an all-day game drive on the second day.  Instead, we spent most of the morning and afternoon being bored around the camp.  Eventually, Joseph contacted us to say he would pick us from the camp at 5pm!  He arrived with the mechanic and we did a one-hour game drive before the park closed.

The next morning we did the only full, private game drive before returning to Nairobi.  So we got 1 proper game drive out of the 4  we paid for.  In Nairobi, Michael failed to show up at our hotel to discuss the poor service. He kept trying to make excuses instead of taking responsibility for the problems with the safari.  I kindly requested a partial refund since we didn't get the private safari that we paid for and he refused.  There was zero accountability!

I would never use this company again due to the lack of professionalism and costumer service. Throughout the entire ordeal, there was almost no communication and direction from the owner.

My worst experience. I booked 5 days Masai Mara with Amboseli, and when i arrive in Nairobi they pick me up then said that they don¢®?t have that tour now ( day before they said that they have).. and they didn¢®?t care about that mistake, I didn't even get an apology, so I was forced to agree to go to something I didn't book , different 5 days trip. When we finish that conversation i sat in the car to start that tour, on the way to safari, after 1 hour i got weird messages and calls on my kenyan number from local numbers and messages like ¢®¡Æf*ck yourself, stupid¢®¡¾ they called me next two days when i was on my safari trip, and i block them, and just people from this agency know my number! Because i bought my sim card on airport on same date, when i arrived in Kenya! I felt unsafe as a tourist, because you don¢®?t know who to ask because the same Agency organize that to me! When we finish that tour after 5 days they were supposed to drive me back to my hotel/airport for free. When we arrive back to Nairobi the girl who told me that ¢®¡Æi have included transport, because if i book 5,6,7 days safari i have included transport¢®¡¾ and now when we arrived she told me ¢®¡Æno its not included (with laughing)¢®¡¾ i have screenshots of our chat if someone don¢®?t believe me. So i was very angry and i went alone back to my hotel with some street taxi because i saw that this agency is playing with tourist. Also for example ¢®¡ÆNaivasha¢®¡¾ its just transport to the place, you have to pay 35-50$ for boat tour or walking, without paying that you cannot enter. Aware that they made a big mistake at the beginning (because i paid expensive ticket to kenya and i didnt see Amboseli what i wanted) and instead of correcting it, in the end they turn out to be even bigger scammers until the end , and I didn¢®?t get a single apology for all of that. I really like Kenya and it was my dream place to visit but this is very sad, if you want to enjoy in beautiful Kenya skip them and find a serious agency who respect their guests.
(Driver James was very nice and kind and i recommend him) but agency is horrible, they don¢®?t deserve more tourists. I have a proof for all of that what i wrote. I booked with this ¢®¡ÆBienvenido tours¢®¡¾ and when i text the number from email they said ¢®¡ÆPurity¢®¡¾ is name of agency, so they are maybe connected. Be careful."
Ed,AU,Visited: November 2018,01-Mar-19,35-50,over 5 safaris,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,1,Everything was substandard after reading other people's reviews. We were mistreated + put in danger,"We trawled reviews and websites looking at hundreds of operators, and settled on Wildebeest in the end because of pretty good reviews and also a willingness to book us in the resort that we wanted to go to. We did not use the one with 1600+ 5 star reviews.   
We agreed on the price and all the inclusions beforehand, to include driver, 3 days 2 nights, all costs included for 2 adults 1 child 1 infant, for air-conditioning, pickup and drop off in Nairobi at specified times, a private 4wd tour, accommodation at our preferred resort, and also air ambulance evacuation cover.  Communication was excellent.    
We were picked up on time.  
We never received confirmation of air insurance till we were nearly home on the last day ? ensure you receive your policy numbers before you leave on safari to ensure you are covered while you are far from medical facilities!  
The vehicle was fitted with a fridge, 2way radio and power points. We were unable to attach our baby seat to the car properly as it did not have the required anchor points for a baby seat- so we had to improvise and use the headrest as our anchor.   
It wasn¢®?t till we hit the dirt roads a couple of hours later where we noticed things going wrong. We had a tyre puncture in the searing midday heat.  I was left in the car with a screaming 6 week old baby.  There was no air-conditioning as promised AND despite their website also stating that ¢®¡ÆALL vehicles are fitted with air-conditioning.
Driving on, our car was filled with thick dust ? there was a hole in the floor allowing dust in.  We resorted to wetting some baby clothes with our drinking water and blocking up the hole so we didn¢®?t choke to death.  The baby carseat I covered with a wet towel to try to trap the dust.  My son was beside himself screaming with dust inhalation and heat. Then the ride got violently bumpy¢®? in fact so bumpy I had to take him out of his car seat and hold him mid-air for suspension.  I was afraid he would get brain damage with the violence of the car. My daughter was telling the driver he was going too fast, she was also being thrown around like a sack of potatos.  Other Wildebeest and safari cars were flying past us without issue.  So here I am holding my baby in a wet wrap over his face mid air for hours in midday heat¢®? I started to message the company owner saying this was dangerous and I wanted the car changed.  He didn¢®?t bother to reply to me.  

Outside the Masai Mara we were asked to change into another Wildebeest vehicle at the entry, and our car was taken to the mechanic. It turns out the suspension was broken. 
The new 4wd was coasting along no issues with dust or bumpiness, so we knew we had been given a lemon of a 4wd.
My review of the resort is on its own post. 
At the resort our driver didn¢®?t engage with us much, sit with us or explain what the plan was, we were just left hanging.   In saying that, he was polite and never rude to us, but lacked communication skills with us. I was watching Dennis, another Wildebeest guide, who ate, laughed and talked to his clients¢®? and enroute was actively chatting, informing and having a great time himself.  

The next day, the driver had lost his keys, so we were put into a van instead, having to get into our 4wd through dodgy unlocked windows to get our things out of the 4wd.  Then someone told him they found his keys so we drove back to the ¢®¡Æfixed¢®¡¾ 4wd.  We noticed more flaws with the truck ? the 2way radio was never on, it didn¢®?t even have a mouthpiece to speak through ? so I guess we missed out on all the game sighting calls and were in danger should we have needed help in an emergency while out on safari.  The drivers door was jammed so he had to exit through the window!  The fridge and electrics just turned on and off with the bumpy roads¢®? flickered and rarely even worked.  Some of the seatbelts did not work, windows were jammed, the car was generally in very poor repair.
We did see all the park animals  - except Rhino, which are too rare.  The following day, we were meant to do a morning game drive, stop at NON TOURISTY souvenir shops  (not the safari preferred ones where they get kickbacks and charge customers ridiculous prices).  Our game drive was a hot footed exit out of the park, the driver didn¢®?t speak, nor slow down, nor look for any animals. By this stage I was so furious with the company, I just wanted to get home.  The owner never replied to my SMS or emails alerting him to the danger to my family and requesting a replacement vehicle.  We had no other way to get home other than the same vehicle back.  We stopped at one pathetically expensive tourist stop ? you know with the special ¢®¡Æguide waiting room¢®¡¾ where they can chat, have drinks and wait for their customers to be ripped off blind and collect a commission.  He knew we wanted to stop at either street sellers or the other numerous shacks set up on the road selling masaii wares, but he didn¢®?t stop at those.   Into Nairobi by 3pm, our driver did help us unpack and then even apologised for the terrible vehicle ? again an admission from the company. 

In ADDITION and the worst of it all ? there is a pop top on the roof of the 4wd. One support strut had rusted through and I had noticed it was cable-tied down to stop it rattling ? rather than being fixed.   While driving home the 2nd strut failed and the roof crashed down.  Had my daughter been standing at the time she would undoubtedly been killed.  For an adult we would have suffered severe injury to the head.

I followed up with Noah the owner ? he told me that the vehicle had come down from the north of Kenya and he had noticed that it was in very poor repair.  Rather than talk to us and reschedule/give us the option, he just allocated it to us knowing we had a newborn and a toddler with us and required safety and air conditioning.  I had even mentioned a reviewer before me mentioned an old vehicle and in poor repair, and had asked for assurance that this was not going to happen to us!  At the end I requested a rebate of $250usd which was roughly the cost of a proper vehicle, which we FINALLY got after harassing them for months. Despite having kids, the owner doesn¢®?t seem to have any insight into the grave situation they placed us in, nor care about his company reputation.   I have read all the reviews, and know someone who has used them multiple times and likes them. From what I saw of other vehicles and Dennis, the company does have the potential to stand up to what other reviewers say,  but we just drew the short straw and were really mistreated and put in danger.

"Edith, Jorge, Denise and Heldy",US,Visited: September 2016,06-Jun-17,50-65,first safari,It Started in Africa,2,It Started in Africa ??An Option?,"I write these commentaries because I believe that we have a responsability with other tourists who, as we did, organize their trips taking into consideration the opinions and commentaries of people in Tripadvisor and Safaribooking.com

I will try to be objective in my commentaries most of all because the experience we lived surpasses all inconveniences and obliges us to put things in their true dimension.   

All coordinations were wonderful, Luis Gama as well as Joao Oliveira replied and answered all our questions promptly and clearly.

What did they offer us:

1 ""Pickup/dropoff from Kilimanjaro airport"" 
We arrived to Kilimanjaro¢®¡×'s  Airport on time, the van that was supposed to pick us up was not there, although we must state that they had arranged for someone to have a  poster and explain to us that they were on their way to pick us up.

2.  ""All our vehicles are extremely well maintained 4x4 Land Cruisers with pop-up open roof"":
It called our attention that the van was not as modern as others we had seen picking up groups of turists.  The handles of the windows   did not work and it was very difficult to open the windows.  The door on the right side did not have an internal handle to open it so we always had to ask the guides to open and close the door for us.

The seat on the second row, on the left, was totally broken so it was imposible to go through  a long journey without causing back pain.  Because of our complains they changed the vehicle.  This was worse because the transmition, the springs, the shock absorber and the two back tires broke.   It was  a miracle that it just added up to a big fright.  I want to take this opportunity  to thank the African Scenic and the group of young doctors of Hong Kong who so kindly helped us and transported us to our camp.  Finally we went back to our first vehicle.  They had fixed the seat but, apparently, the steer started to fail and we wondered if we would get to the airport in time for our flight

3 ""You will have at your disposal, a pair of High End Large Binoculars (Nixon, Olympus of Bushnell) that will dramatically enhance your safari experience when compared to standard binoculars"":
This made us think that each member of the group would have a pair  of binoculars.  It finally happened but only one pair could be considered ""high end"", the others were broken or you could not see clearly.

4.  ""All our safaris have unlimited mileage which means you will be able to do game drives for as long and far as you¢®¡×[would like within the parks operational hours""  Complied

5. ""All National Park entrance and camp site fees""Complied

6. ""Accommodation as detailed""Complied to our total satisfaction 

7. ""All food-breakfasts, packed lunches and evening meals""
 The lodges were responsable for our food and the chefs were very kind and prepared special meals according to our alimentary restrictions, if somebody could not  eat from the buffet. We were surprised, however, to learn that they did not have our meal restrctions registered,  This situation  delayed our trip to the Tarangire National Park because we had to look for a restaurant where they could cook special meals.

8 ""Bottled w?ter and soft drinks""We could always find  bottles of water but never soft drinks.

9. ""Lonely Planet about Tanzania""  In January they offered us that they could buy three of these books in spanish.  We paid for them in advance.  When we arrived, four months after, they had only two books in english.  We understand that it may be dificult to find spanish version but they had four months to do it or warn us that they failed  finding them.  Finally we got a third book in spanish.

10.  ""Our guides, which are our real stars and the ones who can make the difference between a nice trip and a once in a lifetime   journey that you will never forget for decades to come"":

We had Frederick Isangya (Alfred) as our guide in spanish as well as Estomi as our driver.  This was a plus as we were told that the presentations were in english and we observed that the driver was the guide in other safaris.

Frederick answered with certitude all our questions relative to the animals, their habitat and behavior.  He complimented this information with literature that was in the vehicle  and thus allowed us to learn more about this fascinating continent.  He always fullfilled our expectations.  Estomi is an excellent driver and thanks to his skills the accident we had had no mayor consecuences.

Frederick and Estomi, as the visible face of the Company, had at all times the best disposition to face and solve, in the best way, all the problems and inconveniences during the safari.

When they realized that an adequate lunch pack for one of the members of the group was missing they bought a box and searched for  the special meal in a restaurant.  They made the necessary coordinations with the Arusha office in order to find a solution to all the inconveniences that arose during the trip and never avoided the reponsability that ""It Started in Africa"" had towards us.

Conclusion

It Started in Africa did not comply with two fundamental things in order to make a safari successfull  i )  The maintenance of their vehicles and ii) the care of the special food we required.

??Would we hire ""It Started in Africa"" again?   We dont think so, although we must aknowledge that at all times, through their team, they faced all inconveniences.  ??Would we hire Frederick (Alfred) and Estomi?  Yes with no doubt, they were extraordinary.

To finish I would like to state that the group had decided from the very start that nothing  would ruin this marvellous adventure and that our motto, in spite of the problems, always was ""Hakuna Matata"" 

I hope our commentaries may be of help to you

Edua,HU,Visited: December 2019,27-Dec-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Swahili Paradise Tours & Safaris,2,A good start with a terrible end game...,"In the beginning everything was good with this company. I have spoken with Jimmy and he was so nice. I paid half part of the money in the summer. Then he told me my reservation is guaranteed. A few months later in September I got an other message and he wanted the other half of the price because my reservation was not guaranteed anymore. I didn¢®?t want to pay everything in advance but finally I just accepted his argument and we wanted to go there.
After everything was ok. In the first few days our safari was amazing with our guide (Christopher). But after when we were going to back Arusha our experience has become terrible. John (Christopher¢®?s boss) called us because something was wrong with the money and fees on the border of Ngorongoro. So we had to pay more 430 dollar. It was the only one way to go back Arusha. Finally John promised us we will meet in Arusha and he will give back our money in cash. Of course it wasn¢®?t true. John just disappeared and when we arrived to Arusha Christopher got out of the car and ran away. 
After this experience we realized these guys weren¢®?t from Swahili directly. It was a no and company and Swahili just gave us for them. So I can¢®?t understand what happened exactly that day. But we have a really bad experience with this safari so be careful and don¢®?t pay in advance!!!"
El,UK,Visited: December 2018,02-Jan-19,20-35,first safari,Faustin Tour and Travel,1,"Extremely negative - driver was dishonest (took luggage and didn¢®?t show up), bad car condition","I used Faustin¢®?s driver and car because I joined another company - Gamily Tour to Selous Safari and their vehicle was not available one day before due to an accident. Faustin sent a driver John to cover for the transportation from Dar to Selous and driving within the game reserve. 


First thing to state is that the drivers in this company are driving their own cars (instead of company provided vehicles) so the conditions of the vehicles are understandably more variable than other tour operators.

Several things which happened showed that John is dishonest and owns a car at very poor car condition (and other things eg drives aggressively)

1. Dishonest - he took my tour guide¢®?s luggages and never show up!! On the last day of my tour, when John was driving me and my tour guide back to Dar, I discussed with my tour guide and decided that I would try to experience the ¢®¡Ælocal public transport¢®¡¾ thus he and I would get on the local bus for 2 hours. The plan was that John would drive and follow the bus to the station and continue driving me to the hotel. When we arrived at the bus station, John was still at the starting point where we got on the bus (not sure what he was doing for all those times!!). Luckily I got most of my luggages with me, and I didn¢®?t want to wait for him another 2 hours so I took an Uber back to my hotel. My tour guide waited him for another 4 hours and John never showed up, until the next day after we contacted his company (I would have missed my Kilimanjaro hike if I put my luggage in his vehicle)

2. Bad car condition - across the 5 seats in the car, only 1 seat wasn¢®?t suffering from water leakage. Some windows could never be closed. It also could not drive through the roads which other SUV were able to drive through - I was unable to see lions as his car could not drive through one of the flooded main roads leading to the ¢®¡Ælion area¢®¡¾. 

My experience with the driver and vehicle was extremely negative. While I wish that this is only an issue with an individual, seeing from other reviews, seems like there is a company-wide problem. Anyways, even if you happen to use Faustin services, you should request to avoid using John (and his vehicle) at all cost."

Poor equipment and agressive manager.,"We booked a 4days/3nights safari at Tarangire, Serengeti and Ngorongoro crater. No complaints about the safari itself (we saw a lot of animals and enjoy our time) but about the old/ruined equipment used by Meru Trek Company and about the rude modes used by his manager, Ibrahim. 

We had 5 flat tires in less than 2 days!!! I can understand some bad luck¢®?but 5 tires punctured is not a matter of bad luck. It means you have a problem with the tires you are using!! I work for the tire industry and I know what I am talking about. The tires mounted in our jeep had almost no remaining tread and this is, beside a legal issue, a safety problem!!! These 5 flat tires caused not just loosing time from our safari, but also late arrivals to the campsites, to have to mount the tents with almost no light, late dinners and the disadvantage to remain for 3 hours in the middle of Serengeti waiting for someone to come to help us. Not just the tires were not at an adequate level, the driver did not have a proper torch to illuminate while performing the changing operations, the lifter use to lift up the car was getting blocked from time to time and once risked to catch up the driver while changing the tire under the car. Tents used by this company have zips broken, meaning cold and  insects getting into your tent and in case of rain, also the rain (by the way, not all the tents were waterproof either).

When we went back to Arusha and we were taken to the main office, we tried to explain to the manager, Ibrahim that the equipment was not the appropriate and beside not even asking for any excuse, he just became very aggressive, not listening and not allowing anyone except by him to speak. He accused us to ask for a refund (we never mention this word or ask for any money back). Our purpose was to give him a constructive feedback to improve few things, but he did not listen to any reason. He started blaming us we were liars, and saying God will judge us in the Final Day¢®?.Honestly speaking if someone has to be judged is not me¢®?.but the person whose last sentence is¢®¡Æyou should be just happy to be back ALIVE from your safari¢®?¢®¡¾. This is the person you will face if things do not go smooth.

It is up to you the choice, but to me it is not worthy to put your life at risk with bad car equipment, to loose time of your safari, to arrive to campsites late, to suffer cold  because of bad equipment and to deal with this kind of person¢®? at the end cheap turns to be more expensive!

Elisabet,AU,Visited: June 2017,01-Aug-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,Back of Africa Adventure ltd,2,Not what I expected,"In this safari business as in many others in Tanzania, it seems that you are buying from some company in particular but then they just put you with the same budget pack that many others offer. We booked everything through Back of Africa but once we arrived to the office, Allan, whom I have been all the time in contact, was not there, there was no signs or credentials or anything that would refer to Back of Africa. We trusted the guy at the reception, his name sounded like ""Biarman"". So we paid the big amount of money for the safari to him and we didn't even get a receipt. The same guy at the reception was our guide and driver the whole trip. The first day of safari was terrible, the guy was very lazy, not even going out of the car to show us the birds when we stopped at a viewpoint. He could not recognize birds more specificly than the basic information if it was e.g. ""a hawk"". We didn't have the promised binoculars for each neither the guides, not even one for the whole group of 5 people. Then I contacted Allan try to get some clear info about who is the guide we have and for whom does he work. Allan didn't even know the guy, afterwards he said he was new in the company. But the funny thing is that when we asked to Biarman he said that he works for Sandland Tours, the same company as the logo there was in the safari car. There was 1 person in our group that had booked the safari through a completely different company. We never got this thing clear. And it seems a common practice to put people that has booked through different companies together in the same safari. I think that only in Arusha there was something like 280 different companies, but at the end, many of them belong to the same owner, or they just change the name when the company lose its reputation or whatever, but you can never trust that the company you are booking with, will be the same you are actually going with. 

(By the way, Sandland Tours has the worst reviews ever on the Internet...)

Anyways, we tried to make the best out of what we had, we put some pressure to the guide to make a bit bigger effort to find the animals, and it improved, at the end of the day we saw pretty much. I don't think he was a bad guide, but he was not a very good one either. He was just doing his job to get paid, he did not enjoy his job, he was not a nature lover.

The first day we did not have any binoculars, after the second day, we had 1 for 5 people and it was broken and not very good quality. I think it is essential to have good binocular for a safari, and they promised 1 for each, which never happened. We never got any wildlife guide or book.

The camping sites were what they were, don't expect too much, but it was good enough. Our tent was the oldest in the camp and it didn't smell nice. Thank god we brought our own sleeping bags cause theirs were pretty smelly too. We had the poorest chairs to sit during meals, and no chairs at all to be able to relax in the camp site, but the guide had his own nice chair to relax. In some camps there are no lights so they could have adviced to bring own headlamps (we had ours, but other people did not). In one of the camps there was no electricity, so for people without power banks it was a serious problem if you couldn't charge the camera.

There was 2 days that we had to take the cook with us, which make the car not big enough. The cook sat on the front with the driver so we had to share the 4 windows seats on the back with 5 people, while in the national park, seeing the animals.  Specially in Serengueti it becomes extremely dusty, it would not have been a big job to cover the bags on the trunk so they wouldn't be completely brown from the dust by the time we reached the camp.

The safari of 5 days in the 4 main national parks in the North of Tanzania was still worth it for the own awesomeness of the places, but certainly not because of the company we booked with, whatever that company was..."

Ellie,US,Visited: July 2023,01-Aug-23,35-50,first safari,Tourist Line Safaris,2,Not the best company to use,"I did the 14-day Kenya and Tanzania shared group safari.  I¢®?m going to tell an entire story here, and I wouldn¢®?t be surprised at all if TouristLine categorized me as a ¢®¡Ædifficult¢®¡¾ client.  But I do NOT recommend using this agency.

To start, my trip and safari and the food and the people were all wonderful.  However, the guides do not work for TouristLine, they work as contractors through a separate company, so it¢®?s really luck of the draw there.  No matter who you book through, you could end up in a group with clients from different agencies.

My first red flag from TouristLine was that they advertise assistance with booking lodging for any days before or after your safari.  When I asked for hotel recommendations, I was ignored and they asked me for my hotel information for the safari pick-up.  I found a great hotel on my own and didn¢®?t think too much of it.

The start of my trip was difficult, as my luggage remained in NYC and so I had to do some paperwork and make some extra accommodations right from the start.  After the long flight and with the extra stress I just wanted to get to the hotel and shower and make a plan.  I was under the impression that once I left the airport, all of the logistics of travel would be handled by TouristLine.  I was incorrect.  No one picked me up from the airport as advertised.  When I brought this up, I was told that I needed to call once I landed.  Every other time I have had an airport pick-up, they use the flight number to track the flight and I have been picked up without difficulty.  Anyway, I took a $20 cab ride to my hotel.

Out of frustration (that wasn¢®?t necessarily all TouristLine¢®?s fault), I wrote a Day 1 review on safaribookings.com.  The company reached out to me and offered to cancel and refund my safari.  This would have left me without luggage, accommodations, or a safari.  I took the review down and played nice, even though at this point I knew that I was going to experience some bumps in the road.

TouristLine was contacted about my luggage situation.  They were able to verify when the luggage had been put onto a plane and assured me that upon arrival it would be delivered to me.  At this point, I volunteered to give up a day of my tour to make sure that I had my bag before heading out to the parks.  They again assured me that the bag would make it to me and we continued with our original plan.  I had a free day in Nairobi so I went and bought three outfits and some basic toiletries, thinking this would be more than enough to cover me until my luggage arrived.  My luggage arrived in Kenya the next day, which was the day I was set to start my safari.  My hotel pick-up was at 0700 and that went smoothly.  However, my pick-up time was apparently much earlier than the other tour participants because we didn¢®?t leave until around 0900.  If I would have known this, I could have swung by the airport and grabbed my bag and that would have been the end of that.  This didn¢®?t happen, but I was again told that the bag would be picked up and would meet me the next day at the first camp.  I won¢®?t get into too many details, but this back and forth went on for four additional days before I receive my luggage.  While the initial luggage situation had nothing to do with TouristLine, I feel like they gave me the impression that this was high priority but in actuality they did not care at all.  If I would have known that there was going to be a delay that long I would have gotten extra supplies when I was still in Nairobi.

From that point the rest of the Kenya trip went smoothly.  However, crossing into Tanzania started the real problems with TouristLine.  Firstly, I had specifically asked about vaccination requirements, another question that had gone unanswered.  I had done research on my own, but read the requirements incorrectly.  I had to pay $50 cash at the border to get my yellow fever card.  I was also told that Tanzanian visas were gotten at the border, while everyone else in my van had successfully completed e-visas in advance.

Okay, so after customs, I was waiting with another traveler who had a similar itinerary as I did, although he had booked through a different company.  We assumed that we were traveling to Arusha together as we had not been given individualized instructions.  We waited for several hours for a bus to Arusha, but finally boarded and headed to the hotel.  It was at this point that I learned that the bus and hotel were just for my friend and not for me.  NO ONE WAS SENT TO PICK ME UP AT THE BORDER.  If I hadn¢®?t been with a friend using another agency, I would have been completely lost since the border and drop-off point are very chaotic.  

At the hotel I got in contact with TouristLine and asked if it was possible to swap my itinerary to match my travel buddy¢®?s, since it was just swapping the days of Serengeti and Ngororgoro.  She was able to change my itinerary, however, the changes did not put me onto my friend¢®?s tour so we went back to the original plan.  You have to understand, the plans for safaris are pretty much made day to day.  The tour guide seemed responsible for getting people to their next destination, which required a lot of transfer vehicles and last-minute arrangements as they are unaware of each traveler¢®?s individual itinerary.  I heard the phrase ¢®¡Æhakuna matata¢®¡¾ very much during this time.  That is the only reason I thought the change might be able to be made.  TouristLine did attempt to help me make the requested changes and I appreciated the effort even if it did not work out.

The rest of the Tanzania leg of the safari went smoothly.  Even though the tour can end in Arusha or Nairobi according to the website (and TouristLine had a copy of my flight information), my tour seemed to officially end in Arusha.  The hotel I stayed at helped arrange a shuttle for me to go back to Kenya to make my flight.  I had to pay an additional $35.

I am giving you my entire story so that you can judge for yourself.  In my opinion, the agency¢®?s only job is logistics since the tour guides direct the safaris themselves.  As I had issues with my luggage, transportation, and the border crossing, I am not 100% sure what TouristLine did for me.  I¢®?m sure there are a million things they did on their end that I am unaware of, but there are over 400 companies that arrange safaris and I am sure that they all do those same things.  I would recommend trying another company if you want to avoid additional, unnecessary stress during your vacation."
Else,DK,Visited: July 2019,28-Aug-19,50-65,over 5 safaris,Kenya Walking Survivors Safaris Ltd,1,Good until the last two days,"KWSS' website is down and others write the phones are not answered. I guess they're out of business.

Our safari began on the 16th of July and ended the 28th. We had paid the full amount in advance.
After a visit to KWSS' office (O.T. gave a briefing) and we left for Samburu NR.

Zachary, our guide, was very, very good. Amazing wildlife spotting, service-minded, flexible and professional. 

From Samburu to Nakuru, Masai Mara, Lake Naivasha, Amboseli, Tsavo West and East. 

The minibus broke down the last full day. We had trouble teaching KWSS (did not pick up phone on any number, incl emergency no.), but finally, the minibus and guide were rescued and we were allowed to stay at the Man Eaters lodge where someone had brought us (rescued from the broken down bus). We did realize that there was no reservation at the promised lodge (Voi Wildlife Lodge) and even the emergency number wasn't picked up. Communication during July (before departure) wasn't that great too.

We did finally got hold of KWSS and they provided us with another guide and bus as the minibus could not be repaired. We arrived at the airport and caught our plane back home. 

But after all, we were VERY lucky. I guess they closed down right after. A lot of people write SCAM, FRAUD - I think they ran into a liquidity problem. Many had paid in advance (full or 50%) and that money was used on 'something' rather than lodges and park fee etc.  

The guide made our trip and I would have given 4 stars, but I don't won't to lead anyone on to believe there nothing wrong with KWSS."
Eman albustani,BH,Visited: August 2022,04-Aug-22,35-50,first safari,Safari Update Travels,1,Non reliable,"I planned a family trip with my daughter and Kenyan friend to Kenya for first time. I used safari booking to find the right operator.

I selected safari updates based on reviews which was completely misleading.

Silas sounded professional by providing pricing but he did not change the pricing for my Kenyan friend and took 1700 dollars for 3 days trip to masa marai. 

Since we were ladies on own, I requested him for reliable car and he mentioned it 4x4 top luxury which was completely the opposite. 

The car stopped 3 to 4 times because of the battery. It was full of dirty masks, broken handles and the driver Charles didn't knew how to open the socket switches to charge our mobiles. The car provided was not anywhere close the to the pictures. 

I was frustrated by first day and it was too late to change the plan. Then our driver Charles did not know where animals were, he was just roaming around the park following our operator cars.

When I called Silas, he offered us a free trip to masai village as part of the package which Charles did not have clue about. 

The only positive thing about this trip was the hotel people at jambo mara in masa marai. I have to mentioned that they went beyond and above to make us feel comfortable which was completely opposite to what Charles and silas provided. 

If I had the option I would rate Silas 0, I don't appreciate dishonesty specially when I had planned my trip in July and paid 50%. 

I finished my trip yesterday and I called him expressing all of this, he has vanished and never called back.

I was very polite to him until I could not take it anymore. He made constant misogynistic jokes that were clearly a poor cover for his personal insults about my appearance and when confronted with his behaviour then made frequent jibes about 'mzungus' (whilst complaining about previous 'racist' clients). He only seemed interested in whatever meal he was going to get next. There was almost no communication except on the night before the trek and insinuated I would not be able to do it (after carrying on about requiring expensive equipment that was not needed anyway and not bothering to let me know when I could have bought it on the way). He then continued to repeatedly laugh and humiliate me after I achieved the trek. This man is a disgrace but he appears to be highly valued by his employers because he was training another guide. We were also taken back to our accommodation extremely late because my companion was talked into going on a very expensive walk around a resort in a national park. Avoid this organisation at all costs in case you are stuck with your dream of encountering gorillas being potentially ruined. This organisation gets 2 stars because of the accommodation chosen which was lovely."

To describe how this man acts -  when emailing about compensation, he wanted me to forget the cost of the  Gorilla permits, as, in his words the loan made to the tour leader  had nothing to do with Sunrise Eco Tours and they had no knowledge of such a transaction.  When i said this would mean he would have  to pay the $750 back  that had  already been paid for the permits by each of  the 5 people on the tour, (and that we would then send the money to the poor guy that loaned the money for us to attend the trek), he simply refused to reply.

To my knowledge he owes money to the 5 people on the tour described by Lauren above, the Australian couple who have had their tour cancelled, Kavos, the man that lent our guide the money for the Gorilla permits  and also a travel agency which he should have paid commission to

We booked in january 2017, a 4WD for 20 days, 200 USD/day for our trip in Northern Tanzania in july. We paid in advance 4.000 USD for that to an account in Norway (first strange thing for a supposed tanzanian company).

I accepted this fare more expensive that others companies offered because Yoeni Japheth promised us a car ""not older than 3 years"", sending a picture of a very new safari 4WD. I had insisted (that is important for the rest of the story) on the possibility for the driver of passing easily in the back of the car to be able to photograph animals from the pop-up  roof.

On july 15, a car arrived at our lodge one your late with to representatives of ""Drive Tanzania"". But they brought a big landcruiser for 8 people (we were only two) with a barrier preventing the driver from going in the back without going out of the vehicle (what is prohibited in national parks). As I am the driver and the photograph of this trip, this this characteristic would make my safari impossible. Yoeni Japheth did know that perfectly as our mails exchanges attested.

So I said to these representatives that I can't accept this car and wanted the 4WD type we rent. ""Ok, no problem, I will come back soon this the good car, take a coffee, I will pay it"", was the answer in front of several witnesses of our lodge.

But they never came back ! I tried to phone to ""Drive Tanzania"" but their tanzanian number was a fake number. One hour and half later, we received a mail from Yoeni Japheth saying that we ""choose to cancel our trip"" and ""no any other cars are available so we cant help"" ! He didn't even offer any refund.

I immediatly asked Yoeni Japheth to call me to discuss the problem but he refused to do it, repeating in email his false allegations.

He refused later any refund so we loosed 4.000 USD and had to try to find an another 4WD in peak season. Our journey has been deeply disturbed by what I call swindle because Yoeni Japheth, who seems to live in Norway, knew that we need and rent a precise type of car.

Of course, I lodged a complaint against ""Drive Tanzania"" at the Arusha police on July 19. They take this affair seriously.

Eric Buscher,US,Visited: August 2018,08-Sep-18,35-50,first safari,Budget Holiday Safaris,1,DO NOT USE - THIS COMPANY IS DANGEROUS,"I used Budget Holiday Safaris and I have to say not only do I not recommend them, I would warn you from using them. I booked an 11 day safari with them in Kenya and Tanzania. They did not tell me that they don¢®?t handle the Tanzania part but partner with a different agency, Sandlands Tours. I only found out while on the tour and when I googled Sandlands, I found there were a number of customer complaints about them. If they had told me upfront I never would have used them. 
In Tanzania, Sandlands switched drivers while we were staying in the Serengeti. The original driver took all our paperwork and didn¢®?t pay for our time in the park, and when we tried to leave, the park tried to get us to pay over $2500. Sandlands was refusing to pay. Rather than pay ourselves, we called our embassies, who had to put pressure on Sandlands . We had to stay an additional night without food or lodging, and had to sleep in the car with water buffalos and lions roaming around the car. 
When I contacted Budget Holiday Safaris about this issue, their response was just that they would speak to the manager. I emailed them several times after that and they never bothered to respond. It was only when I emailed them that we had contacted the embassies and that I was going to report them as a scam to my credit card company did they bother to message me back, asking me to not do any damage to them. No concern over the situation at all. 
The next day, because of the pressure that this was turning into an international incident, Sandlands relented and paid. However, Budget called me and wanted me to continue on the tour with this company. I told them I no longer felt safe and refused. Other people in my tour got calls from their agencies demanding they continue the safari or else they would be breaking their contract and would be held liable. One woman burst into tears from this. 
Other problems:
?	When we tried to check into our hotel in Arusha, they claimed we hadn¢®?t been booked in and wanted us to pay for our rooms. They claimed we would be reimbursed. When we showed them our forms, they magically found our names in the registration book. This hotel also is the office for Sandlands. 
?	They would consistently put more people in the cars then the maximum promised for the tour. 
?	The vehicles lacked most seatbelts. We had several break down while on the road. The final car had broken windows and no seatbelts and felt extremely unsafe. 
?	We weren¢®?t given meals several times during the trip. 
?	When concerns or issues were directed to Budget, they were dismissed or ignored. Once they just straight up lied to me. 
While Sandlands was the primary agency in Tanzania, they were acting in full cooperation with Budget Holiday Safaris. Neither agency has made any move to apologize for the experience or to make any kind of compensation or restitution. I believe Budget to be fully aware of how Sandlands conducts business in their name, and therefor they must approve or condone their actions. I believe that the actions of these two companies are dangerous and if people continue to use them, someone is going to be seriously injured.

Erica,US,Visited: July 2023,28-Sep-23,35-50,first safari,Go Touch Down Travel & Tours,2,Beware of contract language!,"My family¢®?s experience with Go Touch Down for our ¢®¡Æsafari tour¢®¡¾ was a complete disaster.  I would absolutely NEVER book with them again, even if offered a trip at a fraction of the cost.  They are able to lean heavily on clauses in their stock contract that allow them to entirely modify their itinerary.

Taken directly from the contract: ¢®¡ÆGo Touch Down shall not be responsible or held liable to secure the originally intended vacation package, which in many cases may not be available or its procurement may not be practicable due to forces of nature, market factors, or other related reasons¢®¡¾ and ¢®¡Æ¢®?when deemed necessary in its sole discretion reserves the right to: (1) cancel any itinerary or any part of it for any reason; (2) make any alterations to the itinerary (including, but not limited to, alterations or substitutions of hotels).¢®¡¾  

In other words, they can promise WHATEVER they want and then dump you into whatever itinerary they come up with!  I stupidly assumed this was boilerplate language that we¢®?d have no choice but to agree to in order to sign up for any safari.  But even if it is common contract language, most of us have to trust that tour companies wouldn¢®?t dare abuse it; our experience with Go Touch Down revealed that this is not a company worthy of our trust.

My story is a long one, but here is the gist of key issues (though there were many more, too numerous to cover in detail). Go Touch Down closed one of our two safari lodges six months before our trip.  They did not reveal this to me, but I instead discovered it on my own¢®?even as I was having multiple phone conversations with our agent (the owner¢®?s wife) about our stay at that very lodge because I was trying to make some arrival arrangements.  Of note, Go Touch Down manages the lodges they use on their South African tours, so they knew of the closure, and I found they¢®?d actually removed this lodge from a prominent corporate branding image months prior. When I asked our agent about the lodge closure, she became extremely rude and combative.  Go Touch Down then used contract language to prevent us from getting a refund even though this was going to cut the safari portion of our trip in half and dump us at a freezing cold trout fishing timeshare they manage instead (this was the unfortunate fate for months of guests; we got last-minute lucky when they opened a new lodge just before our arrival and spared us the fish pond). 

While we may have gotten a safari in the end (after so much grief and stress), it wasn¢®?t the one we were sold.  The number one reason I chose this tour had been the promise of a maximum of six people on game drives.  In fact, the brief Go Town Down self-written bio on social media is ¢®¡Æsmall group tours of max 6 people.¢®¡¾  Upon arrival, we discovered that we would have ten people on our game drives ? every seat in the truck filled, including the one up with the driver.  Those squished into the middle seats could barely see anything, especially since nearly all of our drives were in covered-top vehicles and some fellow passengers were quite tall. Even the most barebones budget safari packages generally guarantee an outside seat.  One high-level staff member brought up specifically how unacceptable this was and explained that many game drive vehicles no longer even have middle seats and instead place storage compartments down the middle!  (I¢®?m intentionally leaving out specific details like staff titles and names because I don¢®?t want any of these wonderful people to get in trouble ? we encountered so many who were very candid with us about their extreme frustration with Go Touch Down, and it is a testament to their own professionalism that they did not take out this frustration on their guests.)  The entirety of our Morubisi stay was packed in like this, as was our full day in Kruger (even though in the latter case, we were assured the day prior that we would all ride together to Kruger and that a second game drive vehicle would be waiting to collect half of us for the smaller tour we¢®?d been promised, but this didn¢®?t actually happen).  

Once again, Go Touch Down chose to lean heavily on contract language as an excuse.  We certainly were not the only ones on our tour who were extremely upset, as many had chosen Go Touch Down for the six-person cap just as we had. One fellow traveler then astutely observed that the final documents we received the week of departure had been tweaked to state that any ¢®¡Æoutsourced¢®¡¾ activities, including game drives, may have more than six people.  First of all, Go Touch Down runs the game lodges, so the drives are hardly ¢®¡Æoutsourced.¢®¡¾  Furthermore, this left only the transport from the airport and between lodges as what they¢®?d deem non-outsourced.  Who cares how many people we ride from the airport to the hotel with, it¢®?s the game drives where that actually matters!

There were numerous other key advertised features of the tour that never came to fruition.  For example, there was supposed to be a cultural music performance that never happened.  There was also supposed to be a walking safari, but this was never offered.  In addition, we were supposed to traverse the Panorama Route, a famous region of South Africa, when we were going to travel from Humala to Tshukudu.  With the closure of Humala, we still faced a six-hour drive (not including a lunch stop), but we lost the morning game drive that was supposed to happen on that day and traveled a rather dull route to Tshukudu without scenic stops.  And when we learned we¢®?d be going to Morubisi, we were told of a wide variety of optional activities to choose from, such as a river cruise, to fill the long period between morning and evening game drives.  But when we asked about this on site, we were told that only the reserve owner could drive the boat, and he wasn¢®?t available to do so.  In the end, there were no activities offered to fill the mid-day hours at Morubisi.  Lodge staff were very apologetic and told us that Go Touch Down had frequently shifted financial priorities and was in the process of opening multiple new lodges which was causing not-atypical disruptions that were frustrating for them as well.

To be clear, this review is about Go Touch Down and why I would never recommend booking with them.  The staff at the properties were almost uniformly lovely, and they were very candid about their own hatred of Go Touch Down management and about how guests constantly arrive having been entirely misled and taken advantage of.  ¢®¡ÆThey only know hotels¢®¡¾ said one frustrated high-level staff member who was doing everything possible to give guests the safari experience they thought they¢®?d purchased in the context of a management tour agency that seemed to think we were there for fancy rooms and meals that they attempted to spin as ¢®¡Æupgrades.¢®¡¾  So if your goal is to book an African safari, I would say this is NOT the company with which to do so ? their contract is written in such a way that they may ultimately decide not to bring you to a safari property after all, and even if they do, it doesn¢®?t have to be the safari you were promised.

South Africa is a lovely place, and there were many wonderful staff, animals, meals, fellow tour members, and hotel amenities that allowed us to make the most of our trip despite its many uncertainties and unkept promises.  I have a lot of travel experience and love discovering joy in even the worst of situations.  But ultimately what it comes down to is that Go Touch Down is a company that repeatedly made excuses for not delivering what we as clients were sold.  Maybe they sometimes pull through, but it doesn¢®?t seem like a risk worth taking when there are so many other options out there.  This review has nothing to do with whether I would return to South Africa for a safari or whether the lodges we stayed at were nice.  It is instead about warning people that there are thousands of actual SAFARI booking agencies, so I would highly recommend staying away from what was in our experience the unreliable, contract-abusing Go Touch Down when booking something as special as a safari."
Essid,QA,Visited: June 2018,24-Jun-18,20-35,first safari,Back of Africa Adventure ltd,1,Poor service and knowledge of the package  they are selling.,"At the beginning, everything went smooth: Allan replied to all my emails very quickly but the problem is that nearly all the information he gave me were wrong. I spent 8hours in the van from Nairobi to Masai Mara (Allan told me it takes 4hours) and nearly 10 hours from Mara to lake Nakuru. ( was told 6 hours by Allan). 
I asked Allan if they have a 4wheel drive car instead of the van he told me yes with a 350$ extra per person. We chose the van as it¢®?s cheaper: the problem is that the roads all around Mara were off roads: ( and Allan didn¢®?t tell us of course) we got stuck maybe 4 times in the Mara reserve and twice when we head to lake Nakuru. We lost lots of time: I spent more time in the van than in the parks I came to visit. 
Another thing I didn¢®?t like: as soon as we sent the deposit to book the package, Allan send me an email with what is included and what is not. He wrote that tips are not included and between parenthesis : 10$ per person per day is the minimum. When we arrived to Nairobi and he met us in the hotel, he spent nearly half an hour to convince us to pay the 120$ tips to the driver at the end of the trip. A tip is not a fee or a tax: we are free to pay what we want depending on the service given.
Last thing: in the program there was the lake Nakuru known for the many flamingos that  live and feed from it. But flamingos can be seen only in summer, as during the rainy season the level of the lake goes up and flamingos have to go else where to have some food. This of course was not mentioned by Allan: we spent 10hours in the road from Mara to lake Nakuru only to see the animals that we already have seen in Mara. 
At the end I felt that the only objective for Allan is to sell his package and make money during the low season."

We asked to change our tour guide, since we didn't get along too well because he was just driving up and down the main road in Kruger National Park all the time. We asked him many time to go somewhere else, even saying which roads to drive, and he did want he wanted... We tracked the route with the app Komoot to verify our assumptions, and we were always driving the same main roads. We have seen twice as many animals when we drove through the Park ourselves with our Rental Car, leaving the main Road - without official tour guides.
Brendon & Rene (the owners, I think) were kind while booking, but once it was booked, they were really unfriendly, disrespectful and inflexible.

I would never recommend someone to book with them."

So the next Day, the driver came To take us at out hotel and took us To the office To pay the rest of the amount. The problem is that we were not able To withdraw so much cash but surprisingly the credit card machine that did not work the Day earlier (we asked To use it) was working but we were taxed 5% of the total amout for bank fees...

We finally arrived in Meru after 9 hours drive. When we arrived, we were finally unable To sleep in the parc...and were taken To a nice place outside the parc. We had 3 game drives instead of 4, the cook was not very gifted and the only one thing we asked To the driver (going To the hippopool) he said yes but did not do, with no explaination, except when we asked , he said it was too dry so no hippos. .. apparently according To the local people there were hippos To be seen...imagine our deception. ..

Karibu Safaris put us 9 people in a jeep when the maximum is always 7 people. They breach their specific promise since we asked multiple times to make sure that no more than 7 people will be in the jeep. They simply surprised us in the morning and we couldn't do anything about it.
It should be 6 in the back and one next to the driver maximum, but they decided to make extra money on our back and had 8 people (one sat in the back with no window view) and also a small kid ( so 9 people in total ). Moreover, they tried to lodge two of us in a single room where we clearly booked private rooms."

When we arrived in Arusha, we met Mr. Loi, who, after asking us to literally ""make him rich"" with the final payment, put us on a jeep. 

After few hours on the car we realized that we were supposed to go back to Arusha after a 4-day safari, against the written schedule we paid for.

We contacted Mr. Loi and the kind secretary of Uhuru Travel & Tours, Margareth, that answered Hakuna Matata, everything would have been fixed and never tried to fix the situation

When we arrived in Serengeti, where we should have spent three entire days, we were told that the next morning we would have left the next morning. 

We had to spend hours at the telephone to get what we paid for, since, at the beginning, the agency did not offer compensation for the change of program, then they offered some days in Arusha park. Definitely not what we wanted and we had to receive. At the end, we were abondoned in Serengeti public camp wating an entire day for a driver to pick us up. Finally, the next day a broken and unsafe vehicle showed up without spare tyres and with a leaking tank, which had several mechanical failures and literally fell down while driving, exposing us to the risk to overnight in the middle of the Serengeti.

Once dropped in Ngorongoro we had to wait for another driver, but the authorization papers for the park disappeared with the previous driver.

So, we had an overall bad experience and we would like to advise other people who want to discover the beautiful Tanzania avoiding this dishonest agency.

Evgeniy Taran,US,Visited: January 2016,18-Jan-16,20-35,first safari,Tembea East Africa Safaris,1,"Terrible organisation, many animals.","The good:
We have seen a lot of animals.
Chief has perfect cooking skills. All food were delicious. But not a lunch boxes. They need to do something with lunch boxes.
Parks are amazing.
No matter what you will see bellow, that was a great experience and we are happy.

The Bad:
To be honest, we confirmed our booking a day before safari had to start. And it could cause some issues along the way...
1. We spent half a day in the hotel because guys, as they said, had to go to bank and put money into account. So we lost half the first day. But ok, I understand if so. That is our bad. Also they changed plan without notice. Instead of Tarangire we drove to Lake Manyara.
2. When we came to lake ticketing, I had to pay with my card cuz as it appeared guys didn't put any money into account, so who knows where did they spend half a day. And I had to pay from my card all other park fees also. We tried to solve this small issue with the manager, but they refused to participate.
3. On the line to Ngorongoro entrance we spend 2 and a half hours, while all other drivers did it much faster. Even those who arrived after us. Not sure, driver may had some issues with ticketing. Not a big deal!
4. On the camping side. Tents were very old, no other camping equipment were provided. By saying no I mean we had only tent and dirty-old mattress to sleep on. No slipping bags, covers or anything that could worm us up in the nigh. While all other tents were fully equipped. For info I'm hiking like 15 years,  and never ever had such a bad experience. The very next morning I got sick. Likely girls were fine.
5. Because we didn't have camping equipment we had to change our plan and spent less time in Serengeti and Ngorongoro. And get back to our first camping place near lake which were quite nice.
6. On the last day driver said that he doesn't have fuel and no money for park fees, refused to go anywhere no matter that we had paid for day #4. So I had to come up with idea what to do in the last day. I bought gas, paid for park fee in Tarangire for me, friends and driver with chief.
7. Some issues from the list above I have tried to discuss with manager of Tembia Safaris to find solution. No results, after I have been asked to stop complaining I gave up trying repeating my attempts and we did what we could.

After all that is amazing experience. But maybe with another company.
Yeah, that was  sort of complicated 4 days :)"
EW,NL,Visited: September 2018,01-Apr-20,50-65,2-5 safaris,Bush Baby Calls,1,Worst customer service ever with too many lies.,"Four years ago we did make a gamedrive on our own in Moremi N.P. Unfortunately we got stuck and so we decided in 2018 to go again, but now we did book a ¢®¡Æprofessional¢®¡¾ gamedrive. Not cheap, but we really wanted to see the park this time.
Unfortunately we did get disappointed again. In a very uncomfortable car and an incompetent guide we did not see what we wanted to see. The guide did not know his way around and lucky enough we had still the map of 2 years ago, otherwise we had to spend the night in the park for he could not find the exit. He was alo unable to find the  Black Pool. So sad, because other guides did see some lions there. During the day we saw that nothing did work on the dashboard of the car and that the tires he no profile at all. Because the guide could not find the exit we left the park too late and therfore he drove too fast and if we had not seen a big whole in the road we would have ended up in hosptal. But the emergency stop he had to make because of this, was the end of the car as well. Gladly another car picked us up after a while and did bring us back to Maun.
Of course we did complain and the result was that we should get a refund and than the misery started. Because I am working in travelbusiness I did not go on the internet with this story, to give Bush Baby Call the opportunity to solve this issue in the proper way. He promised to refund us and that was ok with us inspite of our disappointment missing Moremi again. But now after 1,5 years we run out of patience and are really finished with all the lies he told us. A few examples of his OWN MAILS he did send to us:

04-01-2019	You have to check your account in about 7working days i have sent the money this morning
01-06-2019	As for us we will pay your whole amount within this month
16-12-2019	you dont have to make a bad review over $300,00. It will be unfair and you know it.I will send the funds to you.
30-12-2019	I will forward the money when i get back from holidays
02-01-2020	I am going to transfer the money on or before the 30 January 2020
31-01-2020	Can you kindly refresh me with the account details,i seem to have misplaced them,just came back from east africa,i want to forward the refund
04-02-2020	I will definitely send you the proof, i am doing a cheaper transfer method so i will send the proof once it is initiated, please let us finish this transfer,
13-02-2020	Hope this email finds you well, i will make a follow up when i get back to Maun from the safari, i had hoped u have already received it i will also forward the proof.
15-02-2020	I will be back on thursday, i will straight away go to the bank to find out and send proof.
20-02-2020	as far as i am concerned i am not refusing to send you your refund

And many more of these lies. We gave the owner enough time (1,5 years), but now we think the world should now what a lier this person is. Our advice: don¢®?t book here. I think something can go wrong everywhere, but it is so important to solve the issue properly and he failed dramatically.

However after cash payment we never received a receipt. Further they don??t accept dollar notes issued before 2006. This must be informed before.

The Safari itself went fine and we had luck and could see lots of animals in a short period of time. Actually the full day safari has been finished at 16:00, as there was nothing else to see. So we were left at the lodges until next day for the trip back.

The back journey was a bit stressed, as our schedule was very tight. They picked us 40 minutes too late in the morning. However the guide took time to do some shopping on the route (3 times, for fruits and even an alive chicken, for the chicken we had to wait in the car ca. 20 minutes). Then the car??s clutch was broken and we took lunch, while the other car was coming to pick us up. We were brought to a restaurant with the meals on a box.

Fabian,SE,Visited: August 2022,19-Aug-22,20-35,2-5 safaris,Seven Wonders Safaris,2,"Not recommendable! Book your safari with a different operator, safe the trouple!","I booked the 5-Day Group Joining - Manyara, Serengeti and Ngorongoro luxury package with Seven Wonders Safaris.
Initially everything was really great. Evelyn helped me greatly with getting my lost luggage from the airline to the hotel, all the driving worked out really great and the first day we changed the schedule from Manyara to Tarangire (more animals in Tarangire). We had a wonderful day at Tarangire. The driver Nestory was very experienced and a great park driver/guide. The disaster started from day 2!

I got picked up 2h delayed by an old driver called Abdul. Instead of driving towards Serengeti we drove back towards Arusha to pick up other people from the shared Safari. Why he didn't pick up the others first and me last was unclear to all of us. After arriving at the camp side, we had been told that one of the cars is damaged and the entire group of 12 people needs therefore to wait here for a replacement car to arrive. After having lunch and waiting another 2 hours we finally started the drive towards Serengeti. The drive didn't last very long since the police stopped us and denied us the drive, since the car lacked the permit to transport passengers. After waiting for approx another hours we finally started driving to Serengeti. We arrived the Serengeti park entrance just a few min before they closed the gate around 6 in the evening. From there its another 1h drive to the accommodations/camp sides. Here is where the real mess started. Abdul had clearly no idea where any camp side was. So we spend the coming 5h driving through the dark Serengeti Park, while helping the driver with google satellite images. Abdul constantly insisted that he knows the way, while it was very obvious that he was just randomly driving around (trying to enter roads with clear signs private only, making turns all the time, messing up left/right etc). After 5h I gave up finding my accommodation and we drove back to the main camp side, where we figured out that the car with the cook and tents never made it to the campsite. So the majority of the group had to asked complete strangers if they could join them in their tents without a mattress and sleeping bag. Since it was already 1am I decided to sleep with the driver in the car. Luckily for me the damaged car with the tents arrived in the middle of the night and I got a tent to sleep in for a few hours. During the entire day Seven Wonders ignored all our messages! We could reach anyone in their office. Even the day after I got mostly ignored by Evelyn. This was not the luxury version of safari that I pictured.
I am deeply sad to see how bad the company is handling problems. I can totally see how you can have a great time with Seven Wonders, but be aware that the moment anyone runs into problems, you will be let alone by the company. Problems can and will arise, its the way you handle them and how you communicate with your clients!

Seven Wonders tried to make things good the coming days, by providing me with a private driver and refunding part of the trip, which is the reason why I gave one extra point in the rating. But I would not recommend this tour organizer to anyone!

Maybe worth mentioning that paperwork was done wrongly when we left Serengeti and the driver had to bribe the guards to let us leave the park. Also the transport from Ngorongoro to Arusha lacked some kind of documents, so we were driving around police checkpoints or bribing the police officers to keep going."

1) itinerary was completely changed (they said due to availability, even if they confirmed the plan and bookings with the downpayment months ago), resulting in a less efficent tour (hours lost compared to original plan), but less fees for them as we spent less time in parks.. they told us this change only when we were departing for safari, so we had to accept
2) the same day (we arrived) they also told us they changed from a Luxury lodge (Lobo) to a mid-tent (Kati kati)..we potested and they told us lobo was ok; the day we were departing for Lobo they tried to propose to us Savannah (another mid tent) and we said no, so they told us Lobo had problems in availability..we told them to stick with original plan or gave them an alternative luxury lodge (matawi, in which we stayed and liked): they said ok matawi but at 6.30 pm., when we were in front of the lodge, they sent our driver to Osupoku (a mid-tent) against our complaints and we had no chance since the park was closed..at the end they succeded in sending us to a cheap mid-range camp (which we always said no and we paid way more to have a luxury lodge) instead of a luxury lodge we paid for..and they even said it was our idea!!! we protested and promised a refund, never happended
3) the car they gave us was rubbish, having broken differential, battery and fuel mixer from beginning (we had to push the car from day 1 every time to make it start), had no long range radio, no emergency kit, no binocular. Every day there were 2 more problems with the car (day 1 broken radiator, day 2 broken tire support, day 3 broken roof top support, day 4 broken fuel tank) and the car was completely given broken and full of problems.
Every day we went to a different mechaninc and waited hours stopped on the road
4) in Ngorongoro we spent only 2 hours (instead of a full morning) and with a Masai not speaking english and not knowing where to go as the car let us down (even if we espressly requested to be changed or to be checked the day before for Ngoorongoro as it was having problems).

We raised all these problems and all the said was that the car problems were maybe 'immaginary' and that we choose the change of accomodation and that they did not changed the plan,... SCAMMERS AND LIERS..you will loose money booking with them, worst experience."

It was very uncomfortable to travel with him. He never commented his actions. We were driving about 3 hours under the hot sun with no words where are we go and what a going to do. And he had very bad accent. He always said ""glass"" instead of ""grass"" and other words.
Also it is a complaint about hot drinks. It was highlighted in the contract that drinks like sodas and beers are not included. But they didn't say a word that hot drinks are not included into lunches and you should buy it!
But they gave us a better price for that time. But at the same time the hotels and camps they are providing are so poor and incomfortable...."

The 10 day safari tour went to a lot of great locations although you spend a lot of time traveling between destinations....The airport pickup didn't go that smoothly and we got stuck in Nairobi rush hour traffic for a long time....I ended up having 3 or 4 guides during the 6 day Kenyan portion of the tour..(felt like a hot potato).....They were good guides/drivers but it would have been nice to remain with one of them for the duration..(I think the original plan was to have one driver/guide)....Obama was the best driver and pretty knowlegable....


By contrast, the guide/driver for the 3 to 4 days in Tanzania, Sayed, was very hard to understand half of the time and a very poor listener.....(poor english skills overall)....He couldn't find animals on the game drives,  had lots of engine problems in the Serengeti and generally complained way too much about a variety of things......To try to compensate for his many inadequacies, he resorted to offering to buy us beer and ganja/marijuana for us in the van ..(which I think is illegal in Tanzania).....I was told that African Habitat safaris wasn't going to use him anymore as a guide....Excellent choice..


Overall, it was a good time... August is a good time to visit Kenya/Tanzania with a large concentrations of animals... But the tour seemed disorganized at times, the accomodations a mixed bag and the quality of guides dropped a lot in Tanzania...

The safari was not as promised at all. First of all, we had agreed on 4 hour gamedrives on the both first and the third day. Both these days we only spent only 2 hours in the national park. Secondly, our guide, Anthony, did not interact with the clients at all and did not treat the animals with respect. He went off road very often, which is prohibited, and disturbed animals by getting extremely close. Third, our 'semi-luxoury camp' had no electricity and no running water most of the time and if there was, the water had a brown colour. 

When we emailed Noah to express our disappointment after our safari, all he did was offer us to go with his company again on our next trip, which is something I would never do again. Noah said he mixed up the itinerarys of a private and a joined safari, however, the itinerary he sent us before was named joined safari and he had confirmed about lengths of the gamedrives after I had specifically asked him. When we insisted on a partial refund for missing out on half of the safari time on two days, Noah simply ignored this and stopped replying. 

I won't recommend anyone to ever use this company for a safari."
foyboy78,US,Visited: July 2019,07-Aug-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Unique Jungle Tours,2,The office personnel will rip you off here!,"Let me first stop off by saying that the climbing team (Guide, cook, waiter, and 6 porters) was incredible. They were hard-working, fun, and were always positive.

I'm leaving a one star review because of the Emmanuel in the office. 

At my hotel room the night before the climb, we went through what I had packed (even though he never sent a packing list beforehand). He stated that I couldn't wear the shoes that I brought and would need to rent shoes and a mattress to put under my sleeping bag for an additional $65 (extremely expensive). I gave him $70 and never got change back. He said he would be bringing the mattress. The next day we went to a small shop and searched the pre-worn boots (about 8 pairs) and left with one pair that fit. The first red flag was that we didn't pay for them. We just left with the boots.

A few hours later when we arrived at the park, another red flag went up. The office didn't send enough porters to carry the weight of all the bags, tents, kitchen stuff, etc. so when we got to the Kilimanjaro National Park gates, the park made us hire 2 additional porters to carry everything. The Unique Jungle office should have weighed the bags before they picked me up. Additionally, Emmanuel said that he didn't have any way to pay for the additional porters so he asked if he could borrow the $100 USD it would take to hire the 2 additional porters to get us into the park and start the climb. Once in the park, he asked me for a tip for the driver, which seemed odd. I've never tipped the driver in all my travels...its always included.

We finished the climb earlier than expected so there was an additional day to spend in the area. I had asked my guide about a safari and Emmanuel came to my hotel that night with the costs. A boxed lunch was going to be $50! Even lunch in the USA isn't that much!  Needless to say, I declined his entire offer and found my own way.

I would love to hire the climbing crew again if I return. They were great. However, I will not work with Unique Jungle again because of Emmanuel. He is a thief, liar, and lacks any knowledge of true customer service in the travel industry. People are traveling to a new country where many don't speak the native language and because of this there's a certain vulnerability. Emmanuel will take advantage of this situation and of you. Its been a month since my trip, I've asked numerous times and have yet to receive my $105 refund from Unique Jungle."
Frank,DE,Visited: August 2019,25-Aug-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Rhino Explorer Tours & Safaris,2,"Safari in Tanzania is great, but not with Rhino Explorer Tours","A safari in Tanzania is really recommendable, because you can observe really many different animals. However, this is true for all companies that organize safaris, so we would like to review the company Rhino Explorer Tours with their boss Daniel. The organization was unsatisfactory for us for the following reasons:

- On the day of arrival no one came to pick us up from the airport in Arusha, although we send the relevant information in advance by e-mail. We had to organize a taxi ourselves, which Daniel then paid.
- On the second day we should be picked up 8:40 from the hotel. Finally we started around 11 o'clock and after many telephone calls. That was very frustrating as we were not sure if we would be picked up at all.
- On the second day there was no drinking water available. Since we had not prepared ourselves for it and did not bring our own water with us, this was very unpleasant for us. In the end we bought it ourselves after the game drive, although it was actually included in the price.
- On the third day there was no game drive, although it was included in the program. This was due to the fact that we always had to wait on a second Rhino Explorer Tours vehicle had, which never showed up. This led to the fact that we arrived late at the campsite and hat our dinner after 22 o'clock.
- On the fourth day the breakfast was omitted.
- On the last day in Arusha Daniel wanted to come for dinner, but he never showed up. One should not rely on him.
- We did not receive several other things that were promised by e-mail, such as sim card and Masai blanket. We recommend Rhino Explorer Tours therefore not to promise these things in advance if they are not adhered to.

We would also like to add the following points for the sake of completeness:
- We liked the Venice Hotel in Arusha and also the accommodation at Lake Manyara very much.
- We were very satisfied with our driver and guide Francis, a freelancer who was hired by Daniel for the time of our tour."
Franseca,DE,Visited: September 2017,16-Sep-17,35-50,2-5 safaris,Big Time Safaris Ltd,2,Dissapointing,"We chose big time safari for our Safari on the class called budget mode so of course we did not expect great luxuries but unfortunately we had so many problems we wanted to share the experience.
The total days of safari were 11 days.
The worst episode was the second day in Serengeti where the car just broke down, old jeeps are used and you will have many chances that this will happens to you. The whole day was lost and nothing was seen that day. 
After the Safari was over once in Nairobi we did complain at Big time safari offices to get some compensation as the service offered was not given to us. 
The manager, John, was careless and unprofessional as he was more interested in what was happening on the TV than on our complain. He made us waste a lot of time in the office for nothing. The discussion ended up telling us that under his point of view we were not humans as we did not understand his problems and than worst would have been to die in the safari. Once he has your money in his pocket his behavior changes he won't call you back or he will tell you he is busy in some meeting.
Other problems we had was the guide in Tanzania was bad no interest on us. The camp in Amboseli was dirty and no mosquito net was given in one of the beds.
The picnic meals very poor some of the days.
In summary the safari was ok because the landscape and the animals are great but sure thing we would chose different company for a safari."
Fred,BR,Visited: August 2023,26-Aug-23,35-50,2-5 safaris,Fabrics of Adventure Safaris,1,"Bad safari, indifferent to the clients","The agency didn't provide value added to our trip. On the contrary, they ruined it from the beginning. 

1. Misleading statement. I booked this  agency  because its  competitive price given the same package. But unfortunately they didn't provide what they promised. I asked for an open-sided vehicle, which is more expensive than the normal Landcruiser. To make it happen within my budget, I even asked them to downgrade the hotels. They confirmed they can provide the open-sided one as I asked. However, what they provided is just a Landcruiser with the windows  replaced with canvas cover. This was not  even  closer  what  we  wanted. How they  explained? They told  me  the open-sided vehicle that  I asked  can  only  be used  in  the park. Do you think it justified that you  claimed  you have the open-sided one? If  you don't, why not telling me  in the  first  place?? Moreover, at least  other  2 agencies provided  this option(opene vehicle) with  extra fees over than the  normal  land cruiser. 

2. Overpriced package. To have an open-sided vehicle, I proposed to downgrade the hotels. After their recalculation, the total price was almost the same. However, as I said above, they didn't provide the ""upgraded"" vehicle but they downgraded my hotels range. In terms of the same package with a normal landcruiser, this agency charged USD500 more than the quotes we received from other agencies. I wouldn't booked with them if I could know their open-sided vehicle was a lie.

3. Vehicle with bad conditions. You know what? They can not even provide a normal vehicle. What they provided was one without popped-up roof, which means you either close the top cover or leave it completely open. Among the vehicles we saw, ours was the ONLY ONE that didn't have the popped-up roof . If you want to stand up to see the animal, you have to suffer the strong sunlight for the whole game drive because it's not adjustable on on the road.

3.Unprofessional and undevoted guide. The guide hired by the agency was unprofessional and undevoted because 
1) He is always on the phone calls, private ones, joking on the calls. When the vehicle stopped to wait for the animal to move. Other guides usually were explaining the animal to the clients or kept silent, but you know what our guide was doing? Making calls. Sometimes we had to interrupt him to ask him to move forward. Even when we were quite close to a lion, he was still talking with someone in the phone. Using phone always made him distracted, so he drove  very slow. When I doubted the slow drive, he responded safety was the priority. How come using phone while driving could be safe?
2) he was not experienced enough to know where to find the animals, we were often wandering somewhere not even had any aninals at all. When we only missed leopard and chitah, what he did was just idling away in the park Instead of trying to find the animals. Of course we were not demanding that he must find every beasts, but we didn't feel he was devoted to meet clients' expectations.
3) He was not customer-driven. Since the 3rd day, never opened the door for us. In Nakuru, we started safari inthe morning, however we didn't go for flamingo first, instead, he chose a way in the woods to wander about. Until we saw flamingo, it's noon, which the sunlight was not good for taking pictures. When I doubted why we didn't go to see flamingos first, he questioned if I know the way and asked me to trust him.

4. Bad problem-solving altitude. The agency never solved problem we raised, only explained and pretended to understand your feelings. They provided a Landcruser without popped up roof, I asked them to solve. Then they told me the driver will sort it out. However the driver was not able to sort it out. And they just ignored our complaints. This is how they treated the clients.

Never ever  choose this agency!"

A con and possibly a scammer.,"We booked a 3-day tour for 2 to the Maasai Mara for 1120 USD through Lucy Njeri's Splendor Holidays.  This included Park entrance fees, private driver and accommodation. Everything was paid as agreed on time. 

All was well until we got at the Park gate on Dec 13 when we were asked for receipt for the entrance fee which Lucy was supposed to have given to our driver. She had not issued one. Assuming it was an oversight on her part, we paid again 320USD for two of us for the 2 visits to the park. 

I tried reaching out to Lucy with no response. It must be noted that up until that moment, she was was quick to respond especially when part of a payment was due. She could not take our calls, nor the driver's. Our multiple text messages went unanswered. We had other people reach out because it was clear she was ignoring our calls/messages. We hoped that she'd respond to theirs since she does not have their numbers. We were right. She responded to one of them with some shady story that she'd been mugged while depositing cash in her Mpesa account. I call it shady because we did not have to learn about that from other people. Not even her driver knew about it!!! She was ignoring his calls too. 
Anyways she told that friend of ours that efforts were underway to issue a refund to us. She did not tell that to us. Days went by with no word from her despite numerous attempted phone calls. 

Finally on Dec 15, after multiple calls and tests,  she sent a copy-and-paste response she had sent to that friend of ours earlier with the same excuse. We kept asking her when the refund would be issued we never heard back. 

We are now back in Canada unsure how we will get our money back. This has left us feeling scammed and deceived. We were referred to this lady by our close friends and up until that moment we were happy with everything. I don't know what else to call this other than what it isscam, deception, theft and grossly unprofessional.

 I will complain to any authority that can resolve this because it is not OK for our  vacation to have this awful ending. Other vacationers please be warned!!"

The driver tried to fix it just enough to keep going which meant driving in second gear for the entire journey. A 2 hour trip turned into a 5 hours trip which was just to the park entrance. The driver took the car to a mechanic after our game drive, which was limited to just 1.5 hrs due to our late arrival, but had no luck so we continued with no front brakes. On the way back, one of the doors almost fell off and the driver had to secure it using rubber strap. We had to stop every 40 minutes as something else went wrong (low oil pressure, refill leaking radiator). Eventually the car died and we continued our return in a taxi. We wasted another 5 hours getting back to our hotel.  Ann from the agency agreed to compensate each customer USD 50 each, which amounted to USD 200 as we were 4. But as it was a Saturday and she had no cash and we were leaving Iringa, she agreed with the Mama Pizza Iringa Hotel, where we were staying, to deliver the $200 first thing Monday morning which would go towards our accommodation bill.  This never happened, the hotel manager (Richard) called her and went to see her in the office but no money.. always offering another excuse. We tried to contact her but she refused to answer.  Eventually we gave up and transferred the money to Richard so at least the hotel was not out of pocket. This company cannot be trusted and their service was absolutely terrible as was their unsafe vehicles.  As for Ann and the way she managed this situations, she should be ashamed of herself. You can confirm this info with Richard at Mama Iringa Pizza Hotel. "

It is impossible to communicate with the guide due to space and diesel engine unless you are one of two people sitting directly behind guide. The guide stopped to speak only when he or she was planning to speak so there is no ongoing conversation to learn and ask questions. This was a very disappointing experience.

Gaurav,AE,Visited: November 2023,03-Dec-23,20-35,over 5 safaris,Seven By Far Travel,1,Terrible Experience with Seven By Far Tour Agency - Beware of Scams and Unprofessionalism,"We recently returned from a safari trip to Kenya with Seven By Far Tour Agency, and my experience was nothing short of a nightmare. Having had a fantastic trip with them last year(and gave a glowing review), we blindly chose them again, only to be deeply disappointed this time.

From the moment Sylvester, the owner, received the payment, his behavior turned suspicious and scammy. The originally planned stay at Kempinski Resort in Masai Mara, which I had specifically chosen, was not booked as promised. Despite multiple follow-ups, Sylvester only managed to arrange the flights but messed up the visa process until the very last moment.

To make matters worse, the Kempinski Resort, which Sylvester repeatedly confirmed as booked, turned out to be sold out. He then suggested another hotel, which, upon verification, was never confirmed either. Subsequently, he tried passing off a random lodge as a 5-star property and expected us to pay three times the standard rates. Thankfully, I verified this directly with the hotel and found his claim false.

As a last resort, we contacted the Kenya police, who instructed Sylvester to fulfill the original agreement. We reluctantly settled for Keekorok Lodge, which was far from our initial choice. Sylvester had agreed, in both conversations and with the police, to refund $1080, but upon landing in Kenya, he continually postponed the payment date. In the end, he only paid half, citing a dubious withholding tax for the remainder, which I suspect is a form of financial fraud.

Our tour guide, Hassan, was the only bright spot throughout this ordeal. His professionalism and commitment ensured we had an excellent safari experience despite the agency's shortcomings. He is knowledgeable, can spot animals from miles away, and is always mindful to give them space.  I wholeheartedly recommend Hassan to anyone planning a trip to Mara.

In light of these issues, we are filing a formal complaint with the Kenya Police against Seven By Far Tour Agency and its owner, Sylvester. Based on our harrowing experience, I strongly advise fellow travelers to steer clear of this agency to avoid potential scams and unprofessional conduct.

Note: This review is based on factual experiences and is intended as a cautionary tale for other travelers.

We originally booked with him in October 2013 and his reviews appeared fine - 2 months before our trip we noticed a couple of negative reviews about him on tho site. I e-mailed him and he assured us everything was okay and this was simply a man with a grudge about him. When we arrived in Vic Falks he was no-where to be seen - he sent a lady who said histruck was being repaired and he would meet us on the way to Robins Camp in Hwange - the car transporting us continually broke down on the way and we arrived at Dete near Maon Camp and got handed over to another safari providers truck and got taken to main camp. He had sub-contracted part of our trip without notifying us. Hw also hamper not paid for most of our trip in Hwange - denied having received any money and told this company to charge us. We  also were supposed to stay at Hwange Safari Lodge (again pre-paid) and again none of this was booked or paid for. He completely ruined our trip. He is a total con-man and still owes us a lot of money as we had to pay for a lot of meals, drives and accomodation in Zimbabwe. Never travel or trust this man and if you have already booked with him, I would advise you to make alternative plans as he will not fulfill your booking. We are currently I the process of pursuing him through the Hogh Commission and The Zimbabwe Toursir Authority."

They say on the website a maximum of 7 people. At the start of our journey we was 6 which was great as everyone had a window seat and could stand up to watch the wildlife during the safari.
However on day 2, 2 people were forced to join us. Even though we all complained extensively we were told tough. This meant someone had to sit in the front (cannot stand up and only have view of one side - not 360 like all other window seats stood up) and someone stood in the middle (no window seat). We were very cramped up and couldn¢®?t move much. Especially driving over rough terrain in a minivan (not 4x4 with small wheels). 

This is a money making scheme so they didn¢®?t have to paid for another driver and view of a minivan for a 12 hour tour. Yes 12 hours with 8 people cramped in a minivan. This is not what we paid for and nothing was resolved. 

I will never go back to Kenya again, the people were so rude and any opportunity to get money from you. Tried to make us go to the village for 20USD, go on a 450USD balloon ride and also I boat ride that we didn¢®?t care for the price as we knew it would be expensive.

gerald.mcdougal,US,Visited: February 2018,12-Feb-18,65+,first safari,Bison Safaris,1,These people are completely dishonest. Both Maggie and driver Patrick are not honest or truthful.,"The first 3 days of the safari was excellent. I thought our driver was excellent.

Then, the driver, Patrick, cancelled the last game drive on the last morning, cheating us out of the last game drive on the last day of the safari. The schedule called for a total of five game drives, we got four. I thought we had another game drive, but I never had a printed hard copy. I had the schedule on my computer, but internet access was bad at the lodge and the schedule was inaccessable.

I calculated the value of each of the drives at $220 each. 

Patrick was in a bad mood on the last day. I could not get my seat belt fastened, and he impatiently got out and finally got it fastened.  I then unfastened it to make sure it would reopen properly, and then I could not refasten it. He angrily asked why I had unfastened it. I said I wanted to make certain that it would open. I do not want to be stuck in a wrecked van and unable to get out. FIRE?? He could not get it working and I moved to another seat. 

Also on that last day, he refused to stop and allow me to take a photo I wanted. He said no, that the locals did not want their picture taken, and wanted to be paid for it. I said ok, I will pay. He still would not stop.The photo I wanted was of a donkey pulling a very heavy loaded wagon.

It turned out to be an deadly silent return trip to Nairobi. Patrick had previously told us he was tired of the job. This day was totally unlike the first days.

I talked to Maggie about the trip and asked for a refund for the missed last game drive. She offered $20.00. I declined that offer.

Then, Maggie said she finally talked to Patrick. She said that he told her that I called him ""shit"" the entire trip. That was ridiculous. She also said something very strange, that I was ""drinking"" something. I hardly ever drink, and when I do, I am country western dancing and my natural limit is two, and there was no alcohol in the van. That was a very far out claim.

DO NOT PAY THESE PEOPLE CASH- THERE IS SOMETHING VERY BAD ABOUT THESE PEOPLE.

ALL THE SAFARI PEOPLE WANT CASH UP FRONT, WHERE IS THE PROTECTION FOR THE CUSTOMERS??

By all means, go on a safari!  The animals are great! Just don't risk it on these people!"
Geri,HU,Visited: January 2023,19-Jan-23,20-35,first safari,Twins adventures & safaris,1,Most horrible organization and client servize management that we have ever experienced,"DOUBLE ZERO review if it would be possible!!!

We booked a 3 day safari with this organization to Mikumi. The offer was this: 

- 6 hours travel from Dar Es Salaam to Mikumi with lunch then Masai village tour
- full day PRIVATE safari 
- full day Udzungwa mountain hiking tour
- 4th day go back to Dar Es Salaam
Drinks, breakfast, lunch, dinners included everything for 1000$ for 2 people (2022 price)

Reality: 
- 6 hours trip became 9 hours with really short 20 mins break because we did not want to waste time. Rush to the masai village tour. We signed to the organizer the same night that there are huge differences between 6 hours and 9 hours in a car and on our last day we need to catch a ferry which would not work with this long trip. Asked to change for flight or find some solution... 
- next morning it turned out that the Private tour is not private however we booked private tour. Midday I wrote next email about it that basically nothing is the same as in the offer and we would like to find a solution, ask some compensation, or do sg.(dont even talk about the hotel where we were... dirty hot water, airconditioner so noisy that we cant use, etc.) After few hours they wrote back a totally attacking email that everything payed in advance and they will not change the travel for flight because its few thousand dollars. (we asked other guides and they said a 1 way flight to Zanzibar is 120$/person so they didnt even try to ask about fligh possibilities). so generally instead of trying to find solution for our problem they just made nothing. I even asked them to cancel the hiking program and take us back to Dar Es Salaam earlier, give back some money and just forget each other. No answer at all...
- so 3rd day what to do, we went to the full day hiking program. well it turned out that it is only a few hours program, we left the hotel at 8:30 and arrived back to the village at midday (45 mins trip by car). At least the guide adviced a snake farm program that obviously we needed to pay for extra, but at least we could do something. Still we arrived back to the hotel at 1pm... no lunch, no possibility to go out to the village, no activity possibilities in the hotel. basically we could just sit in the bar and drink... 

After all of this I have asked some compensation because basically nothing happened on the way that we booked. No private tour, no full day hiking, 9 hours trip instead of 6 hours and really-really-really horrible client service management. So we had soooo much nervousness during those few days... Obiously they just wrote back an attacking email again and thats it. In the last night my wife was even crying because of the organization...

Anyway the qulity of the programs were okey, the guides made really good job, but this is totally not depending on the organizer...

So in sum, DO NOT BOOK with these guys if you are expecting correct client service and programs that you booked and you expect. DONT pay 100% in advance. That was our mistake too, because otherway they would be much helpfull for sure if we pay for example just 70% in advance and rest in the end of safari. For them only the money is important. After they got it, they give a shit about you, does not matter if you are complaining about something.

I hate to write negative feedback, I even offered them that i will not write anything in case of compensation but it seems the reputation is not so important for them in the 21st century... So I really hope that others will not make the same mistake as us of booking safari tour with this organization.

On 9th September we arrived in Tanzania where we spent the night in Arusha, and on the 10th we left for Monte Meru. While on the trip the manager of Bramwel Adventure Safaris, William Almon phoned our guide to let him know that he had had a problem with his credit card and asking whether I could rather use mine to pay the fee to enter the National Park at Arusha.  He reassured me that he would have refunded me with a bank transfer, since I had already paid everything in advance. In total I paid 595,90 USD.
I went back to Italy on 19th September 2016 and, since then, I have several times written to William Almon asking for my refund. With various justifications he delayed it, though he never denied that he owed me the money. I sent him my last request on 28th December and, once again, William Almon promised that I would have promptly received my refund, but, once again, I have received nothing.

Tanzania is awesome, but not to be confused with the tour company. Driver was clean, polite and helpful but lacked good wildlife knowledge. Didn'y always stop when we wanted to take pictures or observe. Also, 3 days before our departure the company contacted us (after we had negotiated the price and paid a deposit) and said the government had raised the tax by 18% and we had to pay 18% extra. We tried to get a refund or a sufficient email respose, but no joy, so rather than lose the deposit we went with the increase. For our budget it was a hit. Next time I would chose a more ethical company."

Also, it says there will be a hotel pick up and drop-off which didn't happen as well. When I booked, I already mentioned the hotel that I am staying and Peter said he will pick me up. The night before the safari, he emailed and said he can't pick me up because my hotel is far which is unfair because when I reserved a slot, I already mentioned the hotel name. He should have told me when I reserved that he can't pick me. Lastly, they are using a van so it's 3-2-3, a total of eight plus a seat beside the driver which make it really cramped. I noticed the other groups have 2-2-2 plus one beside the driver which make it an ideal set-up."

I used Matembezi to arrange a trip of the East and West Usambara mountains, they were expensive but I picked them as they agreed to supply a specialist birding guide  (Njano Mbilinyi who I had heard was good) I was very clear that I need an expert as the birds in the mountains are difficult to find.

However when I arrived they told me Njano was not available (he had had a better offer) and instead provided a driver/guide who they said was just as good! The reality was the guide provided was just a driver and did not know the birds and was unsure where to find them (and was totally reliant on a bird guide just to guess).  The result was a very disappointing trip which I could have done for less than half the price.

As they knew Njano would not be available they could have 
a) told me and I could have found a different tour guide
b) told me and arranged local guides

instead they seemed to just hope we would not notice! When we complained they just suggested we pay for local bird guides!

On the plus side the driver was friendly and tried his best and we did get to the general locations of the birds safely.

However all in all it was very disappointing, frustrating and annoying - I would suggest you avoid this company

Whilst this may have been accurate and necessary, it wasn¢®?t a sudden occurrence and Simon should have been aware in advance and had our new itinerary in place before our arrival. We met Simon a couple of days before the start of the safari but he didn¢®?t even know then who our drivers would be for the trip, and on the first morning we had to chase to find out if anyone was going to turn up when we¢®?d been ready and waiting to go immediately after breakfast as agreed.

Last night of our tour was listed on their itinerary as Tarangiere Park Sopa Lodge but turned out to be another small venue in Arusha (biggest city in Tanzania). Did not receive what we signed up and paid for. Be careful about this company. I was deceived and would not recommend them."
Gregor,CH,Visited: July 2023,14-Sep-23,35-50,2-5 safaris,Leopard Orchid Safaris,2,a lot of promises but reality was different,"We chose this company because contact with Elija was  very good... The company made a good impression and had good reviews... 
We had a driver and guide Zachary... he was good at finding animals but he is not good guide. he constantly ignored our requests - it was private tour!  he was all the time too late. We heard excuses all the time...
I would like to report briefly the day after the day:
1.  On the first day our driver fell asleep while driving. We didn't feel safe...  We thought - ok. it's first day... Maybe he had something important and couldn't get enough sleep
2. We started second day in Tsavo. It was nice there... We should go at lunchtime to Amboseli and have there afternoon game drive.. He informed us - He needs to have repaired his windshield wipers...  he should know mechanic and it should take us 20 minutes. We spent 4 hours there  and they didn't work. He didn't explain anything to us. we didn't get anything to eat... That day we still had to weld our shock absorbers...Zachary drove really fast on the bumpy road... 
3. The third day in Amboselli was great. We hoped - it will be better... It won't be... 
4. We came to Naivasha - he said us - we should pay for boat ride...  we showed him on the program that this was included. He called long with Elija... In the end we didn't have to pay but that was annoying again
5. We wanted to change our program and do short hike - he told us that it will cost 20 USD... We either had to walk on dusty road or rent bikes because we couldn't get to this trail by car... we learned there that at beginn of this trail were a lot of cars... ok   doesnt matter...  everything cost almost 60 USD... Zachary should wait for us. We came back - he wasn't there. We called him - he said he had a flat tire on the way... We went there by bikes...  that wasn't true. We waited in full sun for him one hour! We lost one hour of our game drive in the afternoon. 
6. It was Friday... We were supposed to spend the afternoon of this day, the next all day and half on the next day (Sunday) in Masai Mara... Its the best park and we wanted to spent there at least. 2 days... 
In the morning we were informed that the rules had changed and we would not be able to enter on the last day. If we want to do that then we have to pay extra 80 USD. Zachary advised us against it because we would have a long way to Nairobi... we suggested: we are going to Masai Mara as soon as possible and we spend more time there on this day. He agreed. On the way he didnt't talk to us... We drove to the camping site and waited there 2 hours - We didn't know what we were waiting for. We think that he didnt want to pay for 2 days in Masai Mara... It was emberassing... 
7. It was great day in Masai Mara. 
8. We visited Masai village and went to Nairobi... We arrived there at 4 pm and we Zachary wanted to take us to the airport (we should spent evening in restaurants... - we had a flight at 4 am and that's why we wanted to spend half a day in the national park and not in the city...  I asked Elija for it in many of mails... We suggested too that we visit Masai village on first day (Friday) -  Visit in Village took us only one hour... It could be a option... Zachary told us - It is impossible - Elijah asked us at airport - why didn't we do it so - We were surprised that he doesn't know it... Zachary called  him a lot... Elijah did us offer and he should react if something doesn't work... 
 
In summary: we heard excuses all the time. Driver was rude and did what he wanted. We suspect - he wanted to pay for everything and wanted to be home so fast as possible. 
He suggested us that we go to airport at  pm.   It's not allowed in Nairobi to come into the departure lounge more than 3 hours before the flight... If we had listened to our guide, we would have spent 9 hours in front of the airport... That shows what a guide is he... 

If you want to go with this company, don't pay the entire amount before the end of the trip. It was our mistake. But they made a professional impression.. I'm giving two stars because we saw a lot of animals... But the guide was unprofessional. 
We want to visit Africa again but definitely not with Zachary...  We thought that he didn't take Elijah seriously either. Elijah made a good impression but for a long time he didn't listen to us but to Zachary...  At the airport he asked us how he could compensate us...  - 
(just one day instead of 1.5 in Amboseli, one day and 2 hours instead of 2 days in Masai Mara...) Sorry Elijah but you should take yours guests seriously... "

We gave him our budget & he agreed to offer a midrange Safari for which he sent us pictures of what to expect and confirmed it would be private camp, he also promised we will have a private bathroom not shared and with hot water. He gave a $20 discount for the students amongst us. We paid him in cash full payment a day before the Safari and at every stage we confirmed what we were to expect. (He still has not given us a receipt)Calvin reassured us multiple times and we have this all documented in writing.

 Unfortunately to our surprise we were put in a public camp site with a dirty public toilet to share with more than 50 people! I brought this up with our safari guide (who was wonderful and I will review him separately) who advised I speak to Calvin as he doesnt know anything about private camping. I contacted Calvin via message and he apologised and said he paid for private camping but somehow ¢®?the government¢®? did not fulfil its promise. He promised to give us a partial refund as soon as he gets it back from the government as he paid for private camping but they gave public camping instead. (We have this in writing)

To this day he has not honoured this despite multiple correspondence which we can provide as evidence. Instead he has changed the story and lied multiple times. In fact he even went on to make derogatory comments about me as an African woman . He also used our pictures without permission to advertise and to my friend¢®?s horror stole her pictures from Facebook and used them without permission.
 
 Calvin will not hesitate to lie and change the story despite all the documented evidence we have. Despite clearly documented agreement he did not honour instead went forth with excuses, insults  and more unscrupulous behaviour. He is currently insisting our ¢®?budget was low¢®? as his excuse as if he was not the one who provided the price for the service and we agreed to it and despite clear correspondence that shows he acknowledged his mistake and promised to make ammends I am appalled that anyone thinks this is a good way to run a business.

Hanna,FR,Visited: August 2022,30-Sep-22,65+,over 5 safaris,Shenton Safaris,2,Very disappointing,"
As always, we enjoyed being in Africa but this was certainly not my best memory.

I¢®?ve done 7 safaris in Africa, including North and South Tanzania, Rwanda, Namibia and Botswana. And Zambia is my biggest disappointment. The walking safaris are much over-hyped in marketing publications and are better in Tanzania.

But if you are determined to go to Zambia, choose the lodges very carefully!

We spent 7 nights at Shenton Safaris Camps, 3 in Kaingo, (a special mention for Catherine, the talented, enthusiastic and thoughtful chef); and 4 in Mwamba Bush Camp, a very disenchanting experience. The day following our arrival, a famous wildlife photographer came with her guests, and ¢®¡Ærequired¢®¡¾ (as we were told by the camp manager) private brunches with her team. We were required to eat alone at our chalet. Despite our protests, we were excluded from the communal meal for the rest of our stay. We were treated as second class customers, at $2K+ per day! 
We also prepaid for a remote sleepout, alone, a 15/20 minute drive from the camp. We were provided a radio transmitter to summon help for any nighttime emergency. When we attempted to use it, we discovered the battery was dead, confirmed by the guide the following morning; very disconcerting.

The owners were aware of our dissatisfaction during our visit. Later they had much to say via email but never visited the camp and never called to discuss any of our concerns. Back in France, in an exchange of emails, it became frustratingly clear that they were either very misinformed or very disingenuous (or both) about the facts surrounding our stay. They offered no apology for their actions¢®?..but a bottle of wine. Ludicrous!"

First of all, this itinerary is really worth following, especially if you don¢®?t want to just follow the usual touristic path.
Unfortunately, during those 8 days we encountered several grave problems with the tour operator and the manager Mr. Dickson Wambugu. The organization and also the handling of occurring problems was highly unprofessional and therefore we do not advise future clients to book tours through this tour operator!
We booked the tour well in advance, and about a month before departure we transferred the total amount (about 4800$) to the tour operators bank account as requested. Apparently the money was needed in advance to book rooms and organize car, driver and cook.
Several  problems occured during the journey 
-MoneyThe driver and guide were not provided with enough money for the package we had booked. So at some point we had to lend them money in order to proceed with our journey, because the tour manager Dickson Wambugu was not to be reached. Highly unprofessional handling of the whole situation and we had to fight really hard to get that money back! Voluntarily almost no communication with the client throughout this whole situation.
-No accommodation was booked in advance even though the tour operator clearly indicates that in the program. That always made us loose precious time.Some of the campsites do not even exist anymore.  
-We booked fullboard. Apparently the driver and cook had not been informed and we had to fight to get it. The food cooked the cook was good, whereas the restaurants offered were very basic and sometimes not very proper. 
-Old car with many security issuesno seatbelts, no equipment (e.g. shovel), broken battery (with no money left to fix it)
Overall, the organization and also the handling of occurring problems was highly unprofessional and therefore we do not advise future clients to book tours through this tour operator! Back in Nairobi we reached out to the tour operator to discuss all problems in person. It remained really unsatisfying, because nothing was really explained and no real apology was presented.
We had a good time during this safari because we tried to concentrate on the positive things, have a good time as family and learn about the beauty of this country. However, having chosen a different tour operator surely could have improved the experience and saved us a lot of stress!

Harry,IE,Visited: December 2021,20-Dec-21,20-35,2-5 safaris,Kenya Bush Expeditions,1,Lying Cowboys,"Kenya bush expeditions lied to me and my local guide about available tickets for the Sheldrick Trust tour for the 20th of December.

On enquiry they said they had 7 tickets available and we only needed 4. They asked for an email to send the payment link and we were slightly skeptical so we offered cash on the day which they agreed.

They charge $50pp US for the tour and the price is actually $15pp from Sheldrick. All they offer extra is pick up and drop off.

On arrival to the Trust, we pulled over and the driver said we had to wait. After questioning he said that we didn¢®?t have tickets and we are waiting to see if there are any no shows. There were 6 other operators engaging in the same activity. Imagine if we had paid online prior!

Absolute cowboys! Sheldrick trust informed us that they are fully booked until the 6th of January and all bookings should be done through them. This company still offers available tickets every single day for the tour, complete liars."
Harry and Hannah,UK,Visited: September 2023,17-Oct-23,20-35,first safari,Classic Journeys Africa,1,Unacceptable.,"We have recently returned from your classic wonders of Kenya, Tanzania, and Zanzibar safari, our honeymoon. We in fact left for home before the end of the booking due to the poor quality of the holiday. Up to this point we have reframed from leaving any reviews about Classic Journeys on your website or on any other platform as I feel it only fair to give you an opportunity to explain why the service was so poor first.

We originally had to delay our safari due to covid (no fault of yours). However, once we had changed the dates to ensure we would be able to go, your communication was terrible, waiting days for confirmation of payment and to get questions answered.
 
We were informed in an email that as we arrived in Nairobi our transfer to our hotel would be waiting for us at the airport with a sign with our name on it. This was the not the case and our driver was not there.  I was unable to reach the driver on the number given to me for him via email. Thankfully a local taxi driver offered to use his phone to call and when we did get though our driver was in bed. We spoke to the office of the company as well and they said that they would get a driver to us in an hour, meaning we would have been left stranded at the airport for over two hours. This is extremely poor service! Our first impression of your company and the start of our holiday ruined, and our first time in Kenya an already stressful situation made extensively worse by Classic Journeys¢®? awful organisation.  

Eventually we arrived at Longview Suites hotel. The hotel was not up to standard in the slightest and did not look like the photo on your website. Our room was metres from a building site (which was the view from our window) and the shower did not work. We were also only provided breakfast in our package on the day of arrival bearing in mind we stayed there for 24 hours and needed four meals during this time. We therefore had to pay more for this. We paid nearly 7000 euro for this holiday and it had become outrageously disappointing at this stage. I appreciate that building work and so on needs to happen but you as a company need to be aware of where you are sending people to stay and change locations accordingly as this was not acceptable. I can send photos as proof of this.

Day one in the bush, again let down. After a long drive we arranged with out guide to go on a nature walk once we had settled in. We arrived at the meeting point but our guide did not, Classic Journeys making a habit of not showing up to where they should be. Nearly half an hour after the time agreed, our guide arrived, and then told us there was no point going for a walk because of the weather even though other walks were going out. This information could have been sent to us and saved us the trouble of getting ready to go out. At this point plans for the next day were sorted as we had become increasingly stressed about meeting drivers at agreed times (note that we had to ask the timings of the next day instead of being told in advance). This as well was very difficult to sort despite being face to face. Again, not good enough and let down.

After one game drive in Kenya with a very mediocre guide who often gave us the wrong information (this information was confirmed incorrect by our second driver), we moved onto Tanzania. Once we arrived at the border, we needed to obtain visas. The link you sent us to obtain visas before arrival did not work and no guidance on this was given. When we were applying for our visas, we were told we had to pay a fee in cash which we didn¢®?t have (again causing more unwanted stress). We were not informed at any point that we needed to take a lot of cash to cover the time away. Cash was needed for almost everything as well as tipping every member of staff we encountered (we were not prepared for this). We were told credit cards were excessively used and they were not and that included some of the camps we were staying on.

After crossing the border and changing cars we settled in for the long drive. We were aware it was a long drive and we needed to get to our lodge for the night, however on a holiday that as previously stated cost nearly 7000 euro, the last place I thought I would be eating lunch was in a petrol station. Completely unacceptable.
 
When we completed the safari part of our trip. We were given tickets for our flight to Zanzibar only to find that Hannah¢®?s ticket still had her maiden name and did not match her passport. We made it clear that this was our honeymoon a name change cannot have come as a surprise. Furthermore, you confirmed receipt of Hannah¢®?s updated passport information on the 16th of March 2023 which gave plenty of time to change the tickets, however this never occurred. This again caused undue stress on a holiday that should have been simple and stress free.
 
As we arrived in Zanzibar, Classic Journeys doing their usual and not being at the airport to pick us up. Two transfers and two transfers not there. When we eventually did meet our driver, the Classic Journeys office felt the need to message me and explain how it wasn¢®?t their fault and that the plane had arrived early which it did by a few minutes. However, this is irrelevant and it is up to you and your drivers to be tracking the flight to ensure this does not happen. If the flight was cancelled would the driver be aware of it or would he wait outside the airport for hours on end? This is yet again unacceptable and poor service. Ensuring you are at the airport on time for a transfer is one of the most basic tasks and yet Classic Journeys repeatedly failed at it.

Uroa Bay hotel. We were sold a relaxing few days on ivory sands and clear waters in a lovely hotel. What we received was an extremely bad day (only one day as we were far to annoyed at this point and we flew home early) on a filthy beach in a hotel where everything was at an extra charge including water a basic human necessity. You as a company need to go to the hotels where you send people to stay and ensure that what you are advertising matches what you are delivering as this did not. The photo of the Zanzibar beach on your web site is clearly not at Uroa Bay. Nowhere in your emails or website did it say we would have to pay extra tax on arrival to the hotel, this was not listed in the ¢®?not included¢®? section. Photos again can be sent as proof. I cannot believe how this hotel was selected for this holiday an unacceptable choice. Also, on the so-called ¢®?private¢®? beach which had a security guard, locals approached to try to sell us drugs. That is not the kind of thing I expect on a holiday resort that has cost me so much. We felt that after the safari part of the holiday, Classic Journeys no longer were responsible and we were left at a bad hotel to fend for ourselves ? this is different to the expectation of a relaxing few days in a luxury hotel.
 
This information on your website and that which was sent to us was not good enough and in some cases just plain incorrect. A standard day on safari as described by your company was, ¢®?up before dawn for coffee and a drive before returning for breakfast and then to take part in other activities. All this before another game drive in the afternoon evening time.¢®? This was not the case, early mornings but not in time for sunrise, leave the lodge do not return till around 1600 with no time to take part in other activities. What you are advertising is not what we received.
 
The itinerary that was sent to us was the only information we received before the trip and this was before we even booked it (which was two years ago due to postponing). There were no updates to the itinerary to fit to the actual timetable of the week and we were not even sent any information to prepare for our trip, for example, a kit list would have been useful. This, bearing in mind, being our first time to Africa and not knowing what to expect. When we asked via email what was needed for the trip, Classic Journeys replied with ¢®?just luggage¢®?.  I¢®?m sure we are not the only customers you have that haven¢®?t been to Africa before either.

This was our honeymoon, it cost us nearly 7000 euros for your package, excluding flights.
Communication was poor.
We were left at the airport twice.
Stayed in a hotel with a not working shower and was practically on a building site.
Were left waiting for our guide only to be told our walk would not go ahead.
Were treated to a lunch in a petrol station.
Were provided tickets for a flight with an incorrect name.
Stayed in an awful hotel that was not anything like the description or photos you sent.
Paid taxes we were not informed of and that were not listed in the excluded cost list.
Were offered drugs in our resort by locals.This is awful on your part and something needs to be done. The price you charge for the standard to deliver is unacceptable.
Thankfully the one time your driver showed up on time was to get us to the air port so we could leave the horrendous holiday earlier than planned.

Also apon return to the UK I have repeatedly tried to contact you about these issues through email, WhatsApp and phone call only to have all of them ignored. "

Disgusting behaviour and we could not be more disappointed with James and this company.  Of course, they'll reappear under another name so be cautious when dealing with any James at a safari company in Africa.  Make sure it's not the same one."
Helen,AU,Visited: September 2018,23-Oct-18,50-65,2-5 safaris,African Coast Travel & Tours,1,"Unsafe, unprofessional and extremely expensive - do not use!","We paid almost as much for an overnight trip to Hwange as we did for a 10 day trip with Nomad and got little for it, as it was little more than 29 hours all up.  You would be better to hire a car and drive to the park, as it is quite safe, and use the safari options at any of the lodges in and around the park. 
Our issues started from at pick up. Mr Moyo emailed he would pick us up, then sent a young driver who was lovely, but no tour guide, and he did not seem to know what was happening or when (but was keen to find out how to get a girlfriend - and visa - in Australia)!
On arrival, our safari truck was broken down and the contracted provider was clearly struggling. A replacement was found after an hour, but both vehicles had clearly been in significant accidents / rollovers. We cancelled the safari the following morning trip as my partner (a mechanic who owned a garage for 15 years) said the vehicle was too unsafe. Pic avail. 
The guide was also lovely as was the lunch, but he was an inexperienced driver and needed more training in guiding. Unlike our highly professional Nomad tour guides and day trip guides, we generally stopped where the guide could see the game but our view was obscured by bush! Each time we had to ask for him to move the vehicle, which resulted in a lot of revving and an overshoot back and forth. By the time we could see, the game had often left! We were also rushing to a schedule, and not following the game. On three occasions we left a spot with game and went to another empty waterhole and waited. 
To top it off, we also found that dinner had not been specified, and had to get the hotel to call to get this sorted. All up, it was a truly disappointing and very expensive experience. Given the professionalism of all of the other operators we dealt with in a month in Africa, this was definitely an outlier. Go somewhere else. "

And our experience was not that great !
I was traveling with my wife, and Amos the contact of us, since the beginning was very impatient and changed a lot of things.
First of all, it was planned to stay in a particular hotel mid range, and we book 4 months in advance.
And 3 days before we arrive they changed our hotel because told that hotel was full!!!
Very unorganized the company!!
Besides that it¢®?s was arranged that we were going to pay by transfer, and Amos again changed what he had combined and told 1 day before that we had to pay in cash¢®?
After all they told a 3rd different hotel to the guide and we were driven to the wrong place after the first safari !!
The second day the same thing happened and the hotel was told that we were going to stay just one night there ! What was not arranged !

The guide was great ( boni) but I don¢®?t recommend this company because the assistance is very bad !!"

Our experience with him as a tour guide was not positive.

At every border control post, he neglected to inform us of the procedure and necessary requirements.

This was also the case during the tour, we were not informed about when to take along water, diesel/petrol etc.

His cell phone was also not roamed.

With regards to confronting him with our problems, he was not approachable and dismissive."

Upon arrival we discussed the planning. However on the balloon trip it was weird they said we had to go to the balloon center when we got in the Serengeti. And make an appointment. Serengeti was day 3. So we visited some parks and upon arrival at the Serengeti it was already weird. We had to wait 2 hours for cash. So we go in the park and ask our driver to go the balloon centers. He confessed that everything was booked months in advance. Okay fine, but then we expect the money back as they didn¢®?t book it. So on our ride back to the airport we would meet the owner. He stalls it, making us wait an hour and almost missing our flight. He didn¢®?t want to pay/didn¢®?t have the money. So we were scammed out 1000 usd. Before flying out of Tanzania I emailed the firm for a compensation. After some pressure from my end they agreed to pay in installments. 4 installments of 250$. The first 2 went fine, the 3rd took 4 months and the last one I am still awaiting. For over 6 months. They said they could not pay the last installment due to cash shortage but that was 6 months ago. Since then they are not replying on emails. 

So DO NOT BOOK ANYTHING WITH THIS FIRM. THEY SCAM YOU AND ARE PROBABLY BANKRUPT."

Of course, James assured me that he would reimburse my money and of course he never did.

Hitesh Shah,CN,Visited: August 2016,11-Sep-16,35-50,over 5 safaris,Tanzania Destination Safaris,1,Worst service ever and you will know why through the ordeal mentioned below,"This is a mail sent to the tour operator and Tanzania Tourism, Tato and safaribookings.com about this agent. 

Dear Mr. Emmanuel,

This complaint letter is to bring to your notice and others that, your service during the 5-Days safari package we had undertaken through your company Tanzania Destination Safaris was pathetic and the worst we have encountered ever in our 20 years of travel life across the world. 

Below I am presenting the account of horror we faced through your utter lack of service, causal and unprofessional approach.

?	Through Safaribookings.com, we shortlisted your company Tanzania Destination Safaris, as our agent for safaris between 21 to 25 August 2016.
?	We opted for your ready package for 5 Days/4 Nights, which included 1 night in Ngorongoro Crater, 2 nights in Serengeti and 1 night in Lake Manyara.
?	Another 4 people joined in for the day package to Ngorongoro Crater.
?	We even paid you USD 30/head extra for the newly introduced VAT, which you claimed was not included in the rate of USD 1305/head as advertised on the website and requested us to pay.
?	The day before the safari, you visited our hotel in Arusha, collected the full amount for all 7 people in advance and introduced us to our guide/driver Khalid, who came to pick us up promptly the next day.

And now our nightmare begins.

?	On the very first day, the safari vehicle engine heated up, and carburetor started leaking in Ngorongoro, right at the edge of Hippo Pond inside the crater. The driver/guide managed to get it rectified. This was promptly brought to your notice.
?	Second day, there was a flat tyre on our way to Serengeti. Out of the two spare tyres at the back, one was already deflated, which is being careless and assuming it is against the law of the land. That¢®?s not all, the jack was bolted badly inside the car and couldn¢®?t be removed, and even the functional spare tyre couldn¢®?t be removed, the tool kit was barely there. A passing vehicle helped us remove the jack. The tyre was removed with great difficulty with the help of few other people from another truck. We even borrowed a spare tyre from a third vehicle, just in case. We wasted almost two hours.

We complained about both these issues to you and you promised to send two spare tyres to Serengeti. The driver/guide says he never received any spare tyres, while you claimed you have sent them. Apparently they were not sent.

?	On third day, we spent more time on getting the tyres checked at the workshops inside Serengeti during the safari.

And on these three days after the safari the driver/guide spent the evenings getting the repairs done, skipping his dinner with us. This we sorely missed, since we were waiting to hear his stories of other safaris.

?	On the fourth day, we were stuck at Serengeti, unable to move to Lake Manyara, because the vehicle had three flat tyres now and no spare tyres. To top it all, the battery had completely died. A service vehicle was called to repair the battery. After a wait of four hours from 7:30 am to 11;30 am, we finally moved towards Ngorongoro/Lake Manyara.

?	At the registration area of Serengeti, the engine was kept alive, while the driver/guide went to finish the paper work. But after half an hour of engine idling, it just stopped. Apparently the battery was dead. Push-starting with the help of others didn¢®?t work. We wasted three more hours there, till another vehicle was organised to drop us to Ngorongoro Crater main office. By the time we reached our lodge at Karatu, it was 5:30 pm. A total of 10 hours through this painfully long troubled day and we could not visit Lake Manyara that evening.

We thought our ordeal was over and next day we can at least cover Lake Manyara for couple of hours before getting to Kilimanjaro Airport for our 3 pm flight.

?	But the last day, at the gate of Lake Manyara registration counter, we discovered that the Lake Manyara entry card was not given to the new driver/guide, who came to fetch us at Ngorongoro gate. We called the old driver/guide, Khalid who was still at Serengeti. He mentioned that he had very clearly informed you to issue new card for Lake Manyara the previous day so that we are not inconvenienced. But you ignored this completely. At the gate, you suggested we pay and you will reimburse us at Arusha.

?	We were certainly unwilling because by then we stopped trusting you completely. You have lied and deceived us throughout our safari and were least helpful in times of crisis. You avoided our calls at Serengeti when we were trying to reach you.

?	We could not visit Lake Manyara for safari, thanks to your deficient service. And as compensation, you gave us USD 100/head. This did not even cover the Lake safari rest alone the trouble we went through because of a defective vehicle and your total lack of professional and ethical approach. In the end, you even refused to meet us at Arusha, instead sending your office staff with USD 300 to pay us.

You and your company will definitely NOT be recommended for anything to do with Tanzania tourism. You spoil the name and efforts of your wonderful country, its tourism department, the Tanzania Association of Tour Operators (TATO) and websites like safaribookings.com.

I request the respective authorities to take action against Emmanuel and his company Tanzania Destination Safaris."
HK,US,Visited: March 2018,25-Mar-18,50-65,2-5 safaris,Shedluck Tours and Travel,1,Think Twice Before You Book with Shedluck,"It is very disappointing when companies do not act fairly. Unfortunately, Shedluck Tours has not behaved fairly. 

For our very first trip to Africa we signed up to volunteer with a medical team. We fundraised and solicited donations of much-needed medical supplies to assist with surgeries in remote Migori. Because the journey is so very long, we wanted to extend our stay beyond the volunteer stint and we chose Shedluck Tours for the additional days.

Unfortunately, despite taking all necessary precautions, I became very ill with GI symptoms, requiring visits to two separate clinics. For medically necessary reasons and on the advice of the Kenyan physician, we were forced to cut our visit short and return home. Prior to becoming ill, we had even more bad luck. Heavy rains led to numerous road washouts and traffic jams (terrible, even by Kenyan standards) caused hours-long detours, meaning that we missed out on many opportunities outlined in the tour itinerary. 

In country, we were too sick to hammer out the details of a refund. Once home, we realized that Shedluck Tours was not planning to return any of our fee other than a very small portion designated for a visit to a village, despite the fact that we had said on more than one occasion that we did not want to visit this village. 

By returning early, we did not venture to Amboseli, a remote area without medical facilities. We did not precipitate a medical emergency that would have endangered my health, nor did we expose staff or guests at the Amboseli Lodge to unnecessary risk. Instead, we made the ethical and medically necessary decision to cut our visit short.

Despite the fact that we did not receive all services outlined in the itinerary due to weather, we did not ask for a refund from Shedluck for those missed opportunities because that would not be fair. These were circumstances beyond everyone's control and they continued to provide services. It seems entirely fair, however, to request a refund for services they did not provide, to share the burden of a trip that was significantly altered and shortened. Unfortunately, they have chosen to ignore my request and have cut off communication.

As to the services they provided, they were basic. I have learned the hard way that there are drivers and there are guides. After assisting with surgeries, the volunteer medical stint included a two-day safari in the Maasai Mara. That company, Frate Tours, provided honest-to-goodness GUIDES. They knew the unmarked roads of the Mara like the backs of their hands. They were as rapt as we were by the animals. They extended our drives to provide us with the best possible experience. They constantly consulted each other and other guides to locate the best sightings. They provided interesting information about the animals and the area. Frate Tours truly went the extra mile. I cannot recommend them highly enough.

In contrast, Shedluck Tours provided a driver. He was a nice young man and we cut him a lot of slack because he confessed to being new, but the difference was stark and obvious from the beginning. He was late to pick up up from the lodge on our first and only day of safari, but we had arrived early (bags all packed) because we had been trained by Frate Tour guides, who were always prompt. We were finally delivered just a few miles down the road to the boat launch. Our driver did not accompany us on the ride and we were expected to tip the boat guide, even though the itinerary did not specify that our driver would not be our guide. After the boat ride, we ate a pre-packed lunch. Instructions on the box prominently advised storage in a cooler to preserve freshness. Our boxes were stored on the front seat. 

Little disappointments continued to pile up. During our one and only game drive, our driver did not yield to animals in the park. Instead, he drove impatiently, even when animals were in the road, causing them to flee. Our guide from Frate Tours always yielded; ""They have the right!"" he said, all smiles. When we came upon a group of white rhinoceros, our driver did not automatically turn around to follow respectfully when the animals passed us. Instead, he hung back and we watched them walk away from us. Frate Tours, would have repositioned us to get a better look while still maintaining a respectful distance. Our driver also never volunteered information about the animals or the location, even though I am sure he had a lot to give. 

Most troubling of all, however, was that when I became very ill, our driver was not on-site. He was not on-site because Shedluck Tours had failed to determine ahead of time that our lodging did not provide any quarters for drivers, despite the fact that they had rooms available. As a result, our driver had to stay in town, some distance away. When notified that I was very ill, he did not show up until hours later. A truly conscientious driver would have returned to the lodge immediately to assess the situation and offer assistance. 

As I said, our driver was a nice young man who was obviously new to the job. I fault the tour operator for not proactively addressing some of these issues (e.g., providing a cooler for lunches) and I especially fault the owner for not doing homework ahead of time regarding the the lack of lodging for drivers.

We took a big risk by signing up with Shedluck Tours because they have virtually no presence on TripAdvisor or any other review sites. They were recommended by another volunteer and the pre-trip communications were all very prompt. In the aftermath of my illness, they have cut off all communications, hoping that I will just go away and give up.

To our relief and complete surprise, we received a refund from United Airlines of the fee levied for changing our tickets, because they recognized that circumstances were beyond our control. They chose not to penalize us for making the right decision. A mega-corporation that receives hundreds of such requests on a daily basis was able to process our refund request within four days. Not Shedluck Tours. In fact, they have yet to process the meager refund that they promised.

If you read my other reviews on TripAdvisor, you will notice that I try to accentuate the positive. I try to be fair and look at the big picture, even if the experience is not 100% perfect. This will be my first truly negative review and it makes me sad. In this instance, however, too many little things add up to a bigger failure. We did not receive excellent service or fair treatment from Shedluck Tours so I urge you to consider carefully before you arrange a trip with them. "
Holly Williams,UK,Visited: February 2018,03-May-18,20-35,first safari,MJ Safaris & Adventure,1,"Poorly organised, vehicle not as advertised, terrible communication","I did a three-day safari organised through MJ. It was a really disappointing experience in terms of the organisation, and not matching what I actually paid for. I contacted the company afterwards and was impressed by Jackson's swift explanation, apology and offer to partially refund the cost - but after successive emails and excuses from them went quiet, and never actually did refund me, which is a really poor way to run a business. 

I am aware joining safaris are liable to be a little slow and chaotic, and I was patient about this - even when I nearly ended up being taken to a different country! But not being provided with the agreed kind of vehicle on the final day made me feel like I needed to officially complain.

On the first day, on arriving in Arusha, I was put on a bus that was going to Kenya - and only realized it wasn't the right vehicle when I was asked for a passport! No-one from the shuttle bus transport company knew anything about a safari. This was alarming, as a solo female traveler suddenly in a different city, not knowing where to go. 

After being driven around for a while by a taxi driver who had no clue what was happening, I had to use my international data roaming to get online to find MJ Safaris number, which cost me a further $10. No phone number was provided when booking. I was then taken to the correct hotel to join a safari group, but it was not a great start! 

On the second day, I was told to get up for breakfast at 6am. After waiting three and a half hours, we finally left at 9.30am. This was frustrating. 

On the third day, again there was a delay at the campsite, as my driver struggled with a card payment. At the entrance to Lake Manyara, we again waited for a further hour - something to do with the card, or it being a Sunday? It wasn't clear. Again, this delay was frustrating. 

Worse, however, was that the car I was in was not a Land Crusier 4x4. It was just a taxi. This meant the windows were blacked out, which was not good for viewing animals. There was a sunroof, but of course it was open to the sky. The sun was very fierce, and I had to avoid it to prevent getting sunburnt, which also made things difficult. They did not have any binoculars, which made viewing animals more difficult. You couldn't stand up when the vehicle was moving, as the sunroof was not padded. I also had safety concerns given there were animals such as baboons who might have jumped in! Finally, the vehicle was clearly unsuited for some of the roads/rivers it had to travel on; it was a very bumpy ride, and the driver was evidently nervous about driving through water. 

The driver did a really good job, all things considered, but the booking specifically stated it would be a different vehicle. 

I was very disappointed by the disorganization of the trip, but especially the fact that it deviated on the last day from the vehicle as advertised and paid for. 

MJ Safaris explained when I complained afterwards that all this was because a group had cancelled at the last minute, and so I had been subcontracted out. I appreciate mistakes can happen, and appreciated their response, which offered to refund the cost of the final day. But it was doubly frustrating to be offered compensation and then just to have follow up emails completely ignored.  "
Hrishikesh,AE,Visited: June 2023,13-Aug-23,35-50,first safari,Morning Star Tours & Travel,1,Disappointing services ¢®? we feel that we have been cheated !!!,"We had reached out to the Company Morning Star Safaris Founder and Chairman Mr Nicholas and Operations Head Mr Robert, but they did not at all care about our concerns. I kept sending them reminder emails and even asked for a video call but they did not have the courtesy to do so. After repeated reminders, when they chose not to respond to us, I told them clearly that now I will find ways through my ownself and expose them in public through this feedback. I was keeping it very very professional and expected the Company Founder to take a stance and come in front, however, it¢®?s very disappointing that the danger that his company had put my family in, did not matter to him at all. I told him I will reach out to the highest authority in Kenya even if it¢®?s the government itself and will fight till I get the Company Founder accept his mistakes and compensate me for the trouble he put my family through, especially my two daughters. 

Please note that this experience was no where comfortable and most importantly very unsafe, despite of all rosy assurances from Mr Joseph. Even before starting the tour, almost a month prior to our travel, my husband made 40%  payment to Morning Star as asked by Mr Joseph. Mr Joseph informed us a day after this 40% payment that Jambo Mara property is not honouring its commitment of the room it had agreed with Morning Star. My husband was forced to make an additional payment of USD 210 for a higher category room which was not required and was way above our budget. But we had no choice as Mr Joseph only sounded helpless.

Everyone makes mistakes and if you accept mistakes and compensate for your wrong decisions and move on, it¢®?s understandable and worth forgiveness but when you stay stubborn and keep making your point without even understanding the customer¢®?s situation, it is alarming!!

I had emailed Morning Star Safaris on July 4th, 2023 marking Urgent Attention to: Mr Nicholas (Founder - CEO of Morning Star Safaris) and Mr Robert (Operations Manager)

We had a very terrible experience with the company Morning Star Safaris. We were being serviced by their representative Mr Joseph and as we had also mentioned to him in the initial days of our vacation reservation with him that we were extremely happy and impressed with the way he dealt with our bookings and also through his communication etiquettes.

However, if anything on my vacation happens that challenges the safety and peace of my family, I just don't buy the fact that Mr Joseph is good at sending itineraries or writing long and reassuring emails and messages, it just DOES NOT MATTER TO ME.

 I must say that Morning Star Safaris may have invested in this company to make profits but it failed in grooming its people to be well behaved, courteous and mindful when interacting with its customers.

I do not accept the way the Company¢®?s operations head camouflaged the whole scenario with his assessment of things. 

Let me ask you first, if you are in my position and have your spouse and two kids off to a vacation, would you take nonsense from your travel partner or your chauffeur? Unfortunately, this is what Morning Star did to us. We left Dubai and arrived in Kenya with all hopes of having a lifetime experience with Morning Star. Mr Joseph kept us in the dark by not informing us that the Land Cruiser that he had assigned to us was not in a well-maintained condition. Can you imagine the Land Cruiser that gets assigned to you for game drives in the jungle at any odd times of the day / night getting stopped on its own in the middle of the road, with no hopes to start again !!! Only when someone pushes the cruiser from behind, it would then start. This was our Day 1 experience with your Land Cruiser that was being driven by Driver Joseph. Even the window panes were so loose and not kept well that it would be difficult to put them up and down. 

Very sad to see the company say that they got us the best Land Cruiser and that they never got any complaints from that vehicle from their past customers.

I wouldn¢®?t have known the true face of your driver or your staff on the very first day. Ofcourse I told Mr Joseph that the vehicle was not appropriate and that the driver was fine. How do you expect me to screen your driver¢®?s intentions the very first day ??

On top of it, there were no binoculars in the Land Cruiser that was assured to us by Mr Joseph while fixing the itinerary. 

I raised this with Driver Joseph the same day and he just said that his vehicle is just fine and maybe this was just a one off instance. I told him clearly that the vehicle should not stop again. I told him about the windows too, ofcourse, but he had no answer. All he said was that his clients had done them bad. On binoculars he said that the travel company never gave him one! Anyway, since it was our first day with Driver Joseph, we thought let's see what he has to offer in terms of the day. One thing I noticed him saying always is that other drivers know very little about the game drive routes through the jungle, so he needs to guide them and be with those vehicles. Ofcourse, we trusted what he said. First day went and we did miss our binoculars, so we told Driver Joseph to speak to the travel company and get one as that was assured to us already. He kept saying that the travel company should do the needful well in time and keep its promises so that the client does not have to suffer. He said he will try to arrange binoculars.

The same evening we called Mr Joseph and told him about the missing binoculars and even the car getting stopped in the middle of the road. As usual, he started with his over sweet sugar coated words and said that he will send his Operations Manager to handover the binoculars to us at sharp 10 am wherever we will be as he will be in touch with Driver Joseph. He also made a note that the car stopped and that he will speak with Driver Joseph. Thinking this may go against Driver Joseph, we told Mr Joseph that the only good thing that happened to us was that he had assigned Driver Joseph as he seems to be quite aware of the routes and can give us a good safari experience, but yes we told him that he must pay attention for the missing binoculars and the poor vehicle condition. He assured us he will look into this.

Day 2 and Driver Joseph again came with no binoculars, no news from Mr Joseph or his Operations Manager. The vehicle in the same condition, poor windows, poor hand brakes and no guarantee if it will stop again and not restart on its own. Moreover, we were supposed to have a packed lunch that we had already placed the order through Mr Joseph 2 weeks prior!! The Hotel Chef during breakfast time came to us asking what we would like to carry for packed lunch as he had no information about it. We were surprised as we expected packed lunch for 4 of us family members, they told us that no one from the travel company or the driver informed them so they did not prepare anything and worst of all the hotel was totally out of stock of any fruits even at 8 am. All the hotel chef could assure us was fried rice and vegetable sandwiches. We were still okay with his offer and agreed and thanked him. But when we opened the packed lunch in the jungle, all we found was white bread with pathetic cucumber and tomatoes and plain boiled white rice (see pics attached). 

When we mentioned this to Driver Joseph, he started putting all the blame on Morning Star for not keeping its promises, he even said that he was not informed by Mr Joseph regarding the packed lunch else he would have coordinated with the hotel staff. He also said that he feels bad to see how travel agencies cheat on their clients. By now, we felt Driver Joseph is innocent and is trying his best to help us in every situation.

We went to the game drive but suddenly we felt odd as we noticed Driver Joseph was only following other vehicles, not trying to explore any known route by himself. In fact he said that other drivers are unaware of the routes so they have requested him to stick along with them. Anyway, we still felt he was being truthful. There came a time when we saw two vehicles stopping near a pack of 5 female lions. Driver Joseph followed the vehicles and took us to the spot. While we were glaring at the lion coming closer to us, suddenly our land cruiser stopped. I didn't realise anything till Driver Joseph muttered the word 'Shit'. He tried to restart and as always it would not turn on. I then realised our vehicle had now stopped and was not restarting. 

Believe me, I froze for those few minutes. He kept trying to restart the vehicle but it would just not start. The driver of other vehicles kept looking at us, and in their own language they started to say something. None of the drivers could get down from the vehicles as the lions were right in front of us and very close. Driver Joseph realised I was in panic, and kept saying that it would restart in a minute. It never did. My husband kept telling me that I should not worry and Driver Joseph would surely have his own way of rescue etc. He kept supporting Driver Joseph as he felt it wasn't his mistake. But my point is, why did our vehicle stop and did not restart ? Why was it malfunctioning in the middle of the jungle, and this was not the first incident. I had already raised this vehicle condition issue with Driver Joseph and Mr Joseph, so definitely they were to be questioned. Those 10 mins, my entire life flashed in front of my eyes, I remembered my parents and I apologised to myself for putting my family, especially my kids in this terrible situation.  Did they deserve this on a vacation ?????????????

Since no one could get out of the vehicle, one of the other vehicles pushed our vehicle and after a few tries, it restarted. I sighed and thanked God immensely. By now, I was absolutely speechless with not a word from me. When Driver Joseph turned the vehicle around, he started asking me for forgiveness and requested me to not complain to Morning Star or Mr Joseph about this incident as has a family to look after, he said the car's condition was not his fault, it is all the company's responsibility. I just kept quiet as I was recovering from the recent shock. Later I just told him to get his vehicle completely repaired no matter what, and he promised me that it would not stop again.

Our Land Cruiser was the only vehicle in the entire Kenya without any company branding!! Look at its covers, stepney covers. I have the pictures with me.

He again started following the other vehicles for further game drive. He then noticed a big deep puddle that had to be crossed as many cruisers were standing across the puddle to witness some more lions and leopards. But Driver Joseph said we should not take the risk with the vehicle and avoid that route. My younger daughter kept crying all through the way as she wanted to see those animals too along with other land cruisers. Of Course we said nothing, as we didnt want another trouble for us. The sun was almost setting down by now.

On his way back, he kept saying that it wasn't his fault, in fact he is taking us to all the routes which no one else knows, rather other drivers are following him. We kept quiet the entire way. He said the next day as per our itinerary, he will take us to Lake Nakuru National Park for sightings of Flamingos and Rhinos. We were excited about it and thought of forgetting the past and enjoying the rest of our game drives. 

Day 3 he took us to Lake Nakuru and we had to just eat lunch and leave. We had informed the hotel 2 hours in advance and pre-ordered our lunch menu. But when we arrived, the food wasn't ready. We had to wait for more than an hour after having pre-ordered our food, informing our travel agent Mr Joseph and even Driver Joseph. We therefore wasted a lot of our time as food came very late and of course I wouldn't ask my kids to gulp everything quickly just because of the game drive.

After food, when we met Driver Joseph, we told him how mismanaged the hotel staff was and that the food wasn't ready when we checked in. At this Driver Joseph said that the lady at reception is very rude and people are complaining about her bad attitude so this has happened to us possibly because of that. We still trusted every word of Driver Joseph as we felt he was trying to be kind and supportive to us in every situation. He took us for a game drive, but he took a very short route where we could not spot any pink flamingos and not a single rhino to be seen. This time he was not following any vehicle and that possibly is the reason we could not spot anything and he finished the game drive in less than an hour!!! We saw the other vehicle taking a different route but our Driver Joseph started going back. We asked him what happened and he just said that it's already 545 pm and we need to exit as it's getting closed at 6 pm. We were very disappointed as we had not seen a single pink flamingo nor a single rhino, forget about lions and leopards. It was a very disappointing game drive as we just wasted our time watching plants and trees and monkeys and a few zebras. On our drive back to the hotel, he kept blaming Morning Star for misleading the clients with wrong game drives, he said the lake Nakuru National Park does not have any flamingos or rhinos. He said instead the travel agent should have booked us on a different game drive and not the Lake Nakuru National Park. He said he felt very bad to see the travel agents cheating on clients like this!! We came back to the hotel very early. Somehow we felt Driver Joseph was in a hurry that day, realising it only later that he had his home in Nakuru.

During dinner time, we happened to meet this other family at the hotel who went for the same game drive and they mentioned they saw plenty of pink flamingos and even the rhinos though they were sleeping at that time. By now I was furious. I immediately called up Driver Joseph and told him that the other driver took the other family deep inside to spot the flamingos as well as the rhinos. I asked him to speak to the other driver and call me back. He said he will check and call me. 30 mins passed and he never called me, I called Driver Joseph again, and he kept saying that he is trying to speak with Morning Star Mr Joseph but there is no response yet, he said he will try to call Mr Joseph again and call me back. I agreed and waited again. He still did not call me back for the next 30 mins. I was respecting the fact that Driver Joseph had asked us not to report anything about him to the travel agent as it might affect his job. But now I felt something fishy. 

This time I called up Mr Joseph. I informed him about the disappointing game drive. He said he was surprised to know that we did not spot any flamingos and rhinos for which Lake Nakuru is known for. He said he will speak to Driver Joseph and call me back. After sometime Mr Joseph called me back and told me that he had spoken with  Driver Joseph and asked him to take us to the game driver again early in the morning so we don't miss out on flamingos and rhinos. He asked us to be ready by 630 am the next day. I told Mr Joseph that breakfast will not be served that early, however, even if we start early we can be ready by 730 am. He agreed. I thanked  Mr Joseph and also told him clearly that we don't want any more surprises now. Mr Joseph kept repeating his sugar coated words and statements - 'We are there to help you ma'am and we will make sure you have an unforgettable experience to cherish for our Kenya vacation.' He kept on requesting that we should be ready early in the morning next day so we don't miss out on the game drive.

I thought let's not look at the past now and instead focus on times ahead. We immediately informed the F&B staff that we will come for breakfast early and they can be ready. They took our pre-order. Next morning I woke up my kids at 445 am so they can freshen up and use the toilet before we ask them to have breakfast. Poor them, they listened to us and we were all ready to go for breakfast. We finished our breakfast quickly, and while we were winding up, my husband called Driver Joseph, and to our surprise he was sleeping!!! He said he had no idea about today's morning game drive. We were shocked to hear this. Now I called Mr Joseph and asked him what's the matter, he again confirmed that he had clearly instructed Driver Joseph last evening and he was supposed to report at 730 am or at best 8 am next day. I really did not understand who was lying between the two.

Mr Joseph said he will call Driver Joseph again and ask him to reach the hotel. Driver Joseph reached very late, 835 am!!! The first thing he uttered from his mouth - 'Not my fault, the company Morning Star never informed me earlier. They told me just now, today morning!!' I lost it by now, I was very angry with Mr Joseph because I thought he lied to us. We told Driver Joseph that how come the other driver could take the other family to spot flamingos and rhinos and we could not. He said he has spoken with the driver and will try today.

When we reached the Lake Nakuru National Park gate, Driver Joseph told us that entry needs payment again. I refused as this was not us but Morning Star who had misorganized everything and put us in this situation. Driver Joseph stopped the vehicle and said that Mr Joseph has told him clearly not to go as he was consu;ting with his management. He started to close down the roof and turn back the vehicle to which we objected. He did not listen and said he could not have entered as Mr Joseph was discussing with management. I now called Mr Joseph and asked him what's happening. I was not able to understand who is lying between the two of them as Mr Joseph said that he has asked Driver Joseph that he is paying at his end and to take us inside. I decided to put both of them on a conference call and asked Driver Joseph to converse in English so we could understand what they were speaking. I kept questioning Mr Joseph on a loudspeaker conference call that why did you not inform the driver about all this payment and today's game drive last night. Mr Joseph confirmed again that he did speak and inform Driver Joseph last night itself and he does not understand why Driver Joseph is refuting that. I now asked Driver Joseph to respond to this statement of Mr Joseph in English. Would you believe he NEVER SPOKE IN ENGLISH!! We understood it was Driver Joseph who had been lying to us since Day 1. He could not once see me straight to my eyes as he was lying. I kept asking Driver Joseph why he was cheating on us all this while. He had no answer at all. You know what he did with us in the middle of the road in the hot sun!!!! He came out of the vehicle and vanished. He pretended he was on call speaking with Mr Joseph but it was my husband Mr Hrishkesh Bawa who was speaking with Mr Joseph on the other line. The vehicle seemed to be even moving as the hand brakes were not perfect. We were now very worried and started to feel unsafe. We called Mr Joseph multiple times and told him to either tell him to enter the Lake Nakuru National Park or tell the Driver to take us to Lake Naivasha which was our next destination. 

Driver Joseph by now was extremely adamant and just was ignoring us big time. He realised we had caught him red handed speaking lies and putting all blame to others. But the way he was behaving with us, leaving the vehicle and disappearing, not telling us way forward, not even bothering to switch on the vehicle AC, not caring at all about two little girls sitting under the hot sun, was making us feel unsafe. We were getting a feeling that this driver can go to any extent of speaking lies and just does not care about anything. He just said that Mr Joseph has not yet made any payment for Lake Nakuru again so he cannot proceed. We had no choice and were stuck in this situation for more than an hour!!!!! After countless back and forth with Mr Joseph, finally the payment was done by him and we entered the Lake Nakuru National Park but imagine the time by now. We had wasted almost 4 hours and don't forget my kids have been awake since 445 am !!!!! They were literally in tears and crying witnessing this whole event, they were not able to understand why this driver was behaving so badly and lying. They told me that they were getting scared of this driver. I told them not to worry and that if anything wrong happens, I will go straight to the police, so they then felt we were all safe and the driver cannot harm us.

Now driver Joseph was really misbehaving as he was not guiding us at all in the game drive route but intentionally was taking us through the same route as the previous day where we had spotted no animals at all. By now, my husband lost his cool and asked him firmly where he was taking us to. Driver Joseph was not even responding. I told him firmly to behave well with us as I was feeling unsafe with him especially with my two daughters. Then he just muttered - 'He is making too much noise and putting pressure on me.'. Now I realised that this driver is acting very oversmart. I was very loud and clear with him that he has been so painful with us and unreasonably difficult and speaking lies all the time that if he misbehaves again or blames anyone else, I will report to the police immediately and tell them how he has harassed us so far and continues to do so. 

Driver Joseph realised that I have understood his strategy of fooling us around and can really take action and report to police. He immediately said sorry and then spoke to the other driver who told us to go to the route which my husband Mr Hrishikesh Bawa had already mentioned to him as we had noticed the other vehicle that side, the evening before, and so finally we could see plenty of flamingos. We also, on the way, spotted 3 Rhinos (though only for a few seconds as they were rushing inside the bushes). But this proved that he had NOT TAKEN US TO THE RIGHT ROUTE the previous day nor he was ready to take us till the time we literally urged him to. Imagine such a waste of time just because of poor coordination between Mr Joseph and Driver Joseph. All they both did was blame each other very conveniently, not realising the damage they were doing to the customer. I told Mr Joseph that I will not leave this matter and will definitely escalate the matter to the senior management of Morning Star. I told him he cannot take this entire experience as a joke as it was a matter of my family's safety and care. 

Mr Joseph kept apologizing but not sure if he really understood the gravity of the situation. I also told him that the way these two people had dealt with us, made us believe they did not have kids themselves. He just kept using his sweet sugar coated words and this was only annoying me by now.

We left Lake Nakuru and then went to Naivaisha for our next sightseeing. We had a boat ride and a safari walk booked but when we went there, we were told at the counter that our safari walk was not paid by the travel agent. We immediately called up Mr Joseph asking him about the confusion and then he said he will sort it out. We were super frustrated by now but who cared ? Neither Mr Joseph nor Driver Joseph. After a back and forth of a few calls, we were told we will be taken for the safari walk. 

But the point is why so much discomfort and dishonesty to the customer? Morning Star charges all money in advance to torture us later ?? I told Mr Joseph that I need to speak with the Founder and Managing Director of Morning Star so I can tell him what mental stress he gave to me and my family. I don't care what you did for us in the itinerary but the fact you gave us such a horrifying experience, I simply ask you to refund every single penny that you had charged me for this trip. I should rather ask you for more compensation for such a pathetic experience and suffering to my family.

And by the way, Mr Joseph had offered us company branded T-Shirts before our Masai Mara trip had to start, he took all the sizes assuring that he will handover the TShirts either before the start of the trip or after the trip gets over. But eventually he never even bothered to inform us or apologise for why he has not handed over the T-Shirts to us. He did not even talk about the T-Shirts after our trip. 

So now I ask you Mr Nicholas and Mr Robert,- What would you have done if this had happened to your wife and kids ? Would you be okay? Would you live your life normal? Would you spare such scoundrels. I will go to every possible social media and share all my recorded phone conversations and chats with Morning Star and its associated staff. The least you could have done was to accept your mistake, take accountability and make a complete refund of my package amounting to USD 2348/-. 

I marked an email to Mr Joseph as I had already informed him about this and I believe in being truthful and transparent in my interactions. He is also aware of the fact that none of the rooms that he had assured us during the bookings were made available to us, instead he charged us additional for one of the hotel rooms. I don't care what you organized for us on the trip and what all you funded because ultimately you put our lives in danger and utmost threatening situations which is absolutely UNACCEPTABLE AND HAS ZERO TOLERANCE

You owe me a response Mr Nicholas  and Mr Robert and I look forward to your urgent attention to this matter and immediate action in the form of a complete refund to me. What you tell your representative Mr Joseph and the driver is not of my concern anymore. I need my refund of USD 2348/- , AND THAT IS IT!!!!! 

Extremely disappointed and devastated,

Hui Fang,AE,Visited: August 2014,02-Aug-14,20-35,first safari,David & Goliath Tours Safaris,1,Dishonest and irresponsible boss,"My husband and I did a 7 days Machame trek and 2D1N safari tour with this tour. The trek was a good experience because of the wonderful guide Bala and his team. However, we had a hard time with the boss David Michael Bungama/David Bungama Nyabirumo. First, he was dishonest with the accommodation arrangement. ALL the arranged accommodations were different and CHEAPER than what was promised over the email exchange. David attributed the change to bad reputation from the promised hotel, but why the vast difference in price and quality? A day before the safari trip, he said he did not have cash to pay the safari guide as the bank was closed that day (sunday). He said we either have to wait till 10am before we can leave for safari or lend him US$350 first and he repay us when we return. Blame us for wanting to resolve the problem quickly and get started on our trip, we agreed and even made him write an IOU. On the day of return, he refused to meet us and asked the safari operator to book us into a US$10 per room (with shared bathroom) backpacker in Moshi! We paid US$700 per person for a 2D1N safari and the lodge in the safari was not fantastic as well!!! Where did all our money go to? We were furious and he promised to meet us the next day which was our day of departure. Not too surprisingly, he only sent the driver to meet us WITHOUT THE US$350 that he owed us! He promised to meet us in the airport after a blasting over the phone with us, but he refused to pick up calls when we were in the airport. Up to the last minute before we need to board, he called back to say he'll fund transfer us. It is our misfortune to have trusted David and engage him. Although he did offer a slightly cheaper price than other operator, he probably made a neat profit through numerous hidden costs or downright cheating. I think dishonest business dealer is the last thing a tourist will want to encounter. Please be careful of this guy and stay clear. He is out to make money but not in the right way.  "
Hulya,AE,Visited: August 2023,13-Aug-23,35-50,2-5 safaris,Monkey Adventures,1,"Tour operator was ok, guide was horrible.","First we would like thank you for always replying quickly and the driver always being on time.

Secondly I would like to tell you what happened on our first day: 
- We landed on time and were stuck in traffic on the way to Lake Navaisha so we couldn¢®?t do the tour on that day so it was postponed for the next morning.
- Because it we did the next morning we arrived late at our hotel in Masai Maraa which resulted in not doing any game drive on day 2,  which we payed you for (80 dollars x 6)
We believe we have the right to get refunded for this. In the future you should not do a heavy planning like this for your guests as with the traffic and condition of the roads it¢®?s not doable.

We also were extremely unhappy about our driver. The driver really breaks or makes your holiday as we spend so much time together. Ours was not providing us any basic information about our day or Kenya, got irritated by our questions, sensitive as not having a sense of humor, demotivated (example: he told us there was a rhino but it was very far meaning he didn¢®?t want to bring us eventhough he knew how much we wanted to see a rhino).
In Masai Maraa he was doing the same routes for 3 days always bringing us at the same spots.
We were the only safari bus with broken binoculars. All other drivers has binoculars looking for the animals for their guests.
He was wearing the same clothes for 5 days so I can¢®?t even begin to describe the smell we had to endure all these hours.
Our driver clearly shows he does not want to do his job and the we were not welcome. 
He also got irritated when we were giving away our extra food to the children we would see because he said they would litter.
Eventhough we were extremely unhappy with him we still gave him a generous tip which he also showed us how unhappy he was with.
We had a fun holiday because we were a fun group not thanks to our driver or accommodation.
I really do not understand all the other 5 star¢®?s reviews and really wished we had a 5 star experience as we paid a lot of money for this holiday.

The lunch box in the accommodation in Masai Maraa was every day the same! Very poor selection for breakfast too. There should be also be mosquitonets as the room is full with mosquitoes and other bugs. We were not so bothered by the accommodation as it¢®?s fairly for the price we paid."
HV,UK,Visited: August 2014,12-Jan-15,20-35,first safari,Big Time Safaris Ltd,1,Very disappointed,"Extremely disappointed with this company. They had good reviews on tripadvisor so I signed up to a safari with this. At 9am I was excited to be leaving my hotel and going on safari. However, it became clear very quickly that I had not been picked up by a Big Time Safari car, but by another company. Big time passed me on to another company without telling me. The company they had sold my trip on to was called Right Choice, and believe me, it wasn¢®?t the right choice. The bus was broken, and it took 9.5 hours for us to drive from Nairobi to Masai Mara. When we finally arrived it turned out that our rooms hadn¢®?t been booked at the camp. Once that was sorted out it turned out that the driver didn¢®?t know what time dinner would be. We went for a terrifying 1 hour game drive that evening. The rain was pelting down and the ground turned into a swamp, and the broken bus (with even less power than these buses normally have) got stuck several times. Fortunately we didn¢®?t end up stuck in the mud in Masai Mara overnight, but between the broken bus and the rain it was more luck than anything else that we didn¢®?t. I cancelled my trip the next morning and returned to Nairobi with a much more professional company. Big Time safari expressed no apology for selling on my trip to another company without notifying me. Nor have they been willing to refund any part of my failed safari."
Iain Oliver,UK,Visited: October 2017,27-Nov-17,50-65,2-5 safaris,Solaris Tours and Safaris,1,"Terrible, feel absolutely cheated. Feel they spoiled what should have been the holiday of a lifetime","Please do not use these people. I do not know if they are fraudsters or just incompetant, but we paid a premium to stay at the plush NGORONGORO farmhouse. They took a 40 % deposit 3 months in advance and the balance was paid weeks before. They said the deposit was required to sucure the rooms. On the day we arrived in Tanzania he emailed to say we had been ""upgraded"" to a tented lodge (we could have booked a tented lodge for $250 less per person) we didn't get the email until they had picked us up because we had no internet. Then that seemed the least of our problemsbecause 4 hours after we were supposed to start our safari we were stillsitting in Arusha high street because there was no money on the entry card for the game reserve. We started to wonder if there would be any safari at all. We thought we might be being kidnapped. We eventually started our safari at 2.30 pm instead of 8 am. Then we were taken to this tented lodge (the name of which translates to  ""mosquito river"") instead of the luxury hotel we had paid for. we also lost another half days safari at the end because our schedule was rearranged  because they had no money on the card so we had to leave early to get back to Arusha by nightfall. a total disaster and no refund. DO NOT USE THESE PEOPLE. 
That said, the animals were wonderful as was our driver/guide (it wasn't his fault) who did his best to salvage his employers incompetence/bad practice."
igor,UK,Visited: September 2014,21-Aug-15,35-50,first safari,Sunway Safaris,2,not worth it. not good value for money,"Sunway Safaris is highly disappointing. saying that, we did see majority of the animals, and the main tour guy was great.

disclosure: below is our opinion only, and we communicated it to the company and they promised to address these for the next tours. offcourse, it doesnt help us.

- lunches were predominantly can food. for 1500 Euro per person, one can provide better food.
- the vehicle is too small for 12 people. we were only 9 with an extra guide (3 guides) and it was cramped. one can use bigger vehicles, particularly for these large distances.
- perhaps the most annoying thing is the mus-information. game drive in Krueger, was literally only drive from point A to point B on our route. we didnt really have the game, off the sealed roads as one promised. we just moved up to Zimbabwe, and whatever we saw - that was the game. the game drive in Chobe, was offered to us for 400 Bula, but when we went to reception, suddenly the price went to 320."
igor,MK,Visited: June 2023,22-Jul-23,35-50,first safari,Kameraz of Afrika,2,Not bad not terrible.,"Too many added costs to the tour. The basically give a driver that knows bits and pieces about animals and he just drives you like a taxi driver from place A to place B. No value for money for some of the ""attractions"" we saw."
Igout Maryse,AE,Visited: July 2017,12-Sep-17,50-65,first safari,Africa Remote Safaris,1,did not take us on safari and did not refund our money!,"Through www.safaribookings.com , my daughter and I have booked a 5 days Safari (from December, 31st, 2016) that should include Serengeti, Tarangire and Ngorongoro (Tanzania) with Africa Remote Safarishttp://africaremotesafaris.com/ . For this we paid an advance of 1200$. We received mails from a so called Naphtally from Africa Remote Safaris confirming our booking.
On December 30th, 2016, we had arrived in Arusha and had still not received any instructions concerning the safari. With the help of the Manager of the hotel where we were staying, we managed to call the Arusha number mentioned on the website and got in touch with a driver who informed us that he had only worked for Africa Remote once. On December 30th, my daughter and I went to bed not knowing whether we would go on safari or not the following day.
In the morning (Dec 31st), we at last received a WhatsApp message from the so called Naphtally indicating that we would be picked up by a driver from another safari operator.
Since ARS had not wired any money to them. We had to pay the full cost of a budget Safari 1800$.
While we were on Safari, ARS wired 440$ to the other Safari operator. This amount was given back to us upon our return by this operator with whom we went on Safari.
Thus, Africa Remote Safari still owed us 760 $. We wrote to them numerous times and once a certain Steve Biko even apologized for the delay and promised that he would soon refund us the money. Almost 2 months later, we still have not heard from him despite our reminders.
It appears that though Africa Remote Safaris claims to have offices in Arusha and Zanzibar, they do not have offices in those places and are only represented in Kenya. The phone numbers mentioned on their sites are only the numbers of drivers who have worked for them occasionally. They also do not have a license to operate in Tanzania and are only represented in Kenya. So if you book with them for a safari in Tanzania all or part of your money may be lost!
We wanted to tell about our experiences with Africa Remote Safaris so that you should avoid a bad and stressful experience on your holiday. They are found directly on (http://africaremotesafaris.com) or through www.safaribookings.com

Ilya,RU,Visited: January 2018,16-Feb-18,20-35,first safari,Tanzania Mwangaza Safari,1,"Beware of cheaters! 'Hello, Tanzania!' are cheaters! In particular Mwajabu.  Safari was terrible","It's a pity to write it but for the next travellers I must do it, to prevent the situations that we were involved and to be ready what to expect from those swindlers like Ms Mwajabu and their company 'Hello, Tanzania'

1. We were the first day in Africa. Mwajabu came to grab the cash for the safari. We were warned that to TZ we need to take just 2006 year released banknotes or above. Of course, we all checked our cash before. It was 2006 or above. We gave money to Mwajabu. After a couple of hours she came to the hotel and told us that 12(!) 100$ banknotes that we gave her were old and 'she is in trouble"". We were confused because we hadn't expected that they are going to cheat us, because some of our friends who worked in the other firm Altezza Tours reccomended the company as their partners. But Mwajabu didn't care about this. All of us were really alarmed and concerned, we didn't know what to expect but we knew for sure that we had given proper banknotes. After we told her about the police and cancellation of safari she said that it would be 'a lesson to her ' and her friend on Zanzibar will help her to change old money. Isn't it funny? All of us, especially girls were a bit suppressed, ' cause it was the first day in Africa for us all and we were dreaming about gorgeous safari. But instead of good thoughts about upcoming safari we had to prove that 'we are not camels' to that woman.

2. Next day. The driver came on 5 a m. The car was small for us 6. and really old. But they actually offered to go 8 persons.. how? The capacity with driver is maximum 8! So we arrived to the lodge in Selous GR at around 10 am, guys from the lodges showed us our tents. Girls were in shock! Tents were tiny for 1 person not even for his big bag! On the pictures they'd sent us the tents were normal big for 2 persons that you can even stand there. We will see such normal tents in Ngorongoro in few weeks later, they were just really comfortable. So certainly we refused to live in such conditions. On the program Mwajabu sent us in advance were absolutely different normal 2 persons tents. What could we do in the middle of Africa? We asked them to give us another accommodation. They charged us more 360$ for us 6 for the wooden hut for 2 and another wooden non condicioned even non fenned hut for 4! 360$ more! Once we lived in Portugal for 350$ for a month in a big flat in the city centre! That's their cheat #2.

3. We've spent about an hour of our game drive time to arrange all the things with accommodation. And now cheat #3: they stated that we can choose that today we go for a half day game drive and tomorrow for the half day. But better not to go today and just go to boat safari on 16.30 pm and tomro for the full day game drive. But stop! In the program it was claimed that on day1 we arrive at 10, having our fast lunch and departing for the WHOLE DAY safari, not even for a half. And there was some logic in it: so why would we have to depart from the hotel at 5am and arrive to the lodge (in Selous) at 10am and just start the boat safari at 4.30pm&?! It's ridiculous! We said that 'no, we going to go now for the whole day and tomro for the whole day' as it was written in the program that Ms Mwajabu sent me via email in advance. But can you imagine our guide Msafiri showed us printed program with the new schedule! Cheaters were ready for any turn! :) But of course i found in my smart phone the real program and showed it for the guide. For the long time he was talking on the phone and finally agreed on what we had insisted. Like Mwajabu did when she failed with her trick with banknotes. So we've spent a lot of time and nerves again. Why they did like that? We found out later that the entrance fee costs for a 24 hours visit to the park 70$/person. So they tried to convince us to go just for a one day game drive to save 420$ and put them into their pockets. Of course everything including park fees we've paid in advance.

4. The safari was ok. But not impressed. You know, 50% of success depends on the guide. The guide - Msafiri was not very communicative. His English was ok, but we haven't been catching not any word because of the strong accent. He was not very friendly, and he was wearing not a neat clothes as other safari guides did, not like a hint for uniform, just like a local guy from the village. Probably not a big deal but It's also very important for the whole impression about the company.

5. The icing on the cake was that on the last day they sold us lunch boxes for 10$ each! But it really costs less than a dollar: dry old chicken leg, bred with carrot, juice.. 

So the whole impression was very bad, they were trying to deceive us every time they got a chance. So thank you, Mwajubu for the spoilt safari and first impression about Tanzania. You're not even think for the future, I told you that if we'd love the safari we'd definitely go with your company fot the northern curcuit. And thanks God we found another great company with honest and pleasant people working there who changed our opinion to the country and people. We went back home absolutely satisfied and pleased. Tanzania is amazing!

We have all scans, documents, photos, programs, witnesses to prove my words. So, guys, be aware of that company and Ms Mwajabu. Actually we can even bring an action for the court, because they rendered their service not loke it was claimed in the contract and forced us to pay more money cheating us with accommodation.

She didn??t want to take us to the places we had paid for and instead she took us to two places in order to buy... She wanted us to leave very expensive tips (more tan 20%) In Kruger the ranger explained in English in order that she could explain it to us but she never translated. The group was in Spanish and most of them couldn??t understand the ranger (she was very polite and the dirver too). MIRKA got confused with the timetable and was rude to us because of her mistakes.

Ines,BR,Visited: August 2023,29-Aug-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Fabrics of Adventure Safaris,1,Biggest flop of my trip.,"1.	Agreement discrepancy. 
They did not deliver the service they promised. We paid more for an upgraded open-sided vehicle as they promised they would provide, but they sent us a Landcruiser without a popped-up roof and below industry standards. One day during the Safari, because there was no roof to cover, I got sunstroke and ended the day's trip early.

2.	Cover up problems and shirk responsibility. 
When we questioned that the vehicle they provided was not what we required, they kept trying to cover it up, telling us that the Landcruiser was the industry standard and that no guest had ever questioned it (with an ironic tone), and requiring us to bear it as there was no other option. However, we were not questioning Landcruiser, but that they did not provide an open-sided vehicle as they promised.

3.	Their quotation is more expensive for the same services.
Taking the price we paid as a reference, they did not provide an open-sided vehicle which generally requires an additional $700, therefore, in fact, their quotation was $500 higher than other agencies for the same services. Don¢®?t choose them and save your money?¢®

4.	Irresponsible and lazy tour guide.
The tour guide they arranged for us was extremely irresponsible, often driving while making personal phone calls. 
Example 1: In Mara, it is 20 kilometers from our hotel to a gate of the park, and it took him 70 minutes to drive us there. Then wandered 2 kilometers near the gate for a whole morning and we saw almost nothing.
Example 2: When we parked just 1 meter away from a lion ready to hunt, he kept talking and laughing loudly. We tried to stop him, but he continued on the phone for 40 minutes. At last, the antelopes were scared away by his voice, and the lion gave up hunting. We missed a great scene that could have happened, which made us very upset.
Example 3: He lacked a basic sense of service and courtesy. Firstly, I want to clarify that we have treated him politely and respectly. However, he didn't share enough information with us, didn't thank us for tips and snacks, interrupted us, and argued loudly with us.

Do not choose this travel agency, they will ruin your trip!!!

Ines,AR,Visited: October 2018,24-Oct-18,20-35,first safari,Sandland Tours and Safaris,1,Horrible experience,"Me and a friend ended up with Abraham Shaidi's company (Sandland) as a third party booking. We didn't knew about them at the beginning.
The first day it took us 12 hours to arrive from Arusha to Serengeti, because we made like 6 stops waiting for everything that was supposed to be arranged before (the chef, the food, the vegetables, going to the office, etc).. so we only got to see the animals that day for only one hour.
In the meanwhile, in the same car there was a lady that had a totally different itinerary than ours. We were supposed to be 2 days in Serengeti and 1 in Nogorongo, in campsites. Hers was 3 days in Serengeti and 1 in Nogorongo, in lodges. Nobody (even the guide) knew what will happen with this differences..
Finally it happened that our third day we were supposed to go very early to nogorongo and spent the day there, but we had to wait for almost 4 hours for Shaidi to pay the Lodge of the lady so they would let her and the guide go. For that reason, we couldn't do the crater that day so we had to stay one more day. The chef didn't have food enough because he calculated for 3 days, not 4. And we didn't have any mattress for the third night!
The guide was payed only for three days so he had to return to Arusha an leave us in nogorongo de third night. We didn't know what was going to happen the next day. Finally when we woke up the 4day the other lady was again waiting for Shaidi to pay the Lodge. Another driver went to pick her up and pay for it. Then they came to pick us up, but the crater permit wasn't payed.. so we have to wait again almost 3 hours, and finally we had been in the crater only for 2.
The new driver was just a driver, he didn't know anything about animals.
To sum up, this company and Abraham Shaidi are a shame. Please don't book with them. Nobody knows what he does with the money. Is nonsense."
Irena,SI,Visited: January 2020,01-Mar-22,35-50,2-5 safaris,Ringo Adventure Safaris,1,Terrible - he is a cheat !! Do not use this company at any cost!!,"In January 2020, we have arranged and paid for a 15 daytravel for 5 person in Tanzania with agency Ringo Adventure Safaris from Kenya- Diana beach. The travel included trekking for 3 person at Kilimanjaromountain (6 day - Marangu route) and a 4 day safari in the NP Manyara, and NPNgorongoro with accommodation in Serena Lodge Ngorongoro. We have is fully paid for all and that we have the account(paybill) of Ringo Adventure Safaris, signature of director Mr. Amos, which theright or original of the name is Hamisi Bekari.

We pay this man the extra moneyfor stay in Tanzania in the hope that he will be taken care of by ourworry-free travel for all 15 days from start to end¢®? BUT¢®? The case is such:Ringo Adventure Safaris, Amos told me that in Tanzania working with a localagency to Bestday Safaris. It has proven to be a lie, because the Bestdaysafaris does not have any contracts for our trips and travel (I was spoke withMr. Peter from Bestday Safari after our travel¢®?). In fact it is he Amos-HamisiBekari ? Ringo Adventure Safaris) with the Tresa Trekking and a Safari fromArusha, to which the director was supposed to be Thahit Kassim Juma. Later, itturned out that the agency is not registered as an agency acting illegally inorder to avoid the payment of the state fee and taxes.

In conclusion, the Amos-Hamisi Bekari, the director of thetourist agency of the Ringo Adventure Safaris from Kenya is a collaborationwith the Thahib Kassim Juma (nonexisting  and engaging in unauthorized agency, TresaTrekking and Safari) to steal our 2.785$. :

According to the contract it is our journey that we hadpaid for the Trekking Kilimanjaro for 6 days for 3 people? with an extra day ofacclimatization at the Horombo hut) but  to get there, we get only five (5) days,without the extra day of acclimatization. (Which may be the reason that one ofthe members was unable to conquer the summit Uhuru peak.).

Without our knowledge for only 5 days it's Thabit KassimJuma orders the mountain guide Jeff before treking (one day before we havemeeting in Altezza lodge in Moshi with Amos, Thabit, Jeff and our guys whowants and pay for treking ? this day we are talking around 5 or 6 days and wetold Jeff (and Thabit and Amos9 that we paid for 6 days¢®?). Immediately aftergetting out of the trek we order to Thabit that he must refound money-back,becouse they didn't have 6 days treking¢®?. Since then we didn't seen Thabit anymore¢®? , and this moment started a complication in the communication between thethis two of 'maneger' Amos and Thabit. They can't spek at phone or whatsupbecause they haven't connection ? this is lie of course¢®?

Later on, we were the injured of the two the most expensiveof the day that we have a pay for? NP Ngorongoro and stay in the Serena Lodge Ngorongorofor 5 person. That we didn't get and don't see it. Thabit said to me on phone,that Amos didn't pay for this to him... But Amos said to me on phone that he ispaying the Thabit all of money for everythin around our conntract , but he giveall the money in his (Thabit) hands witout any contracts or account or paybill¢®?he just give the money in his hands. I can't belive this¢®? this is so stupid andI'm not an idiot¢®?

In my opinion is that they are to prepare all this togetherand both together they are thiefs and wants to stole our 2.785$. Amos ? HamisiBekari from the agency's Ringo Aventure Safaris ? he promise to me that he willrefund all this money of 2.785$ to me¢®? however, of the 17.in January up totoday, 09.in march we have not received even a single dollar. It is all justtalk. The theft of the money, I signed up Tanzanianand the Kenyan police, andnotification to the competent department for the operation of travel agenciesin Kenya and Tanzania.

CAUTION FOR YOU: PLEASE IF YOU WANT TO GET WHAT YOU PAY AND IF YOU WANT TO HAVE ANUNFORGETTABLE HOLIDAY WITHOUT A LOT OF TROUBLES¢®?. NEVER CONTACT ANY OF THOSE TWO AGENCIES :

RINGO ADVENTURE SAFARIS (FROM KENYA ? DIANI BEACH) OR.AMOS- HAMISI BEKARI

AND

TRESA TREKKING AND SAFARIS (FROM TANZANIA ? ARUSHA) ORTHABIT KASSIM JUMA (this man is a fraud and a liar, which is the one ofavoiding the payment of taxes and the receipt of the money in his hands and liethat he has an turist agency Tresa¢®? this agency is not registered and worksunlawfully and all business is illegally¢®?)

!!! Both of these men: Amos or Thabit will destroy yourholidays and steal your money!!!!

Since today (March 2022) he never answers to me from 2020 despite all his promises how will return our money!"
Irene,NL,Visited: March 2023,31-Mar-23,65+,over 5 safaris,MoAfrika Tours,2,Disappointing experience,"We booked a 2 day safari tour and stayed at Ivory Tree Lodge. The rooms, food and open game drives provided by the lodge were excellent. The transfers from Johannesburg provided by MoAfrika Tours did not meet our expectations. Although we advised we would be travelling with 4 suitcases, no provisions had been made on the outbound transfer so the suitcases needed to be stacked in the aisle. The outbound transfer was a disgrace. Just before checking out of the lodge we received an email, offering us a choice between being picked up at the arranged time 11:30 AM) and spending time in Pilanesberg on a closed game drive. Or spending time in the lodge and being picked up at 2:00 PM. We chose the first option but ended up spending 3 hours in the reception area for our transfer. The people at MoAfrika Tours kept telling us they did not know why the driver did not pick us up but he would be there within 10 minutes. He arrived a little before 2 PM and was met by a group of angry people (7 in total) who had been waiting since 11 AM. And 2 people who had chosen the second option, to be picked up at 2. The driver told us that the people of MoAfrica were well aware that he would not be able to pick us up before 2PM as he was in the park woth another group of people. So obviously it had been the intention of MoAfrika from the start to pick us up at 2. They just were not honest about the situation and kept us waiting for 3 hours without food as they had us believe the drivers would be there any minute. To make things worse, the driver was supposed to wait until 3 PM to pick up 3 more people. After we refused to wait any longer (5 of us had flights to catch), he decided to leave the other 3 behind and drove us to the airport. The driver was not to blame for this mess up, solely the people at MoAfrika office.
After returning home, we sent a complaint to MoAfrika, but we have not received a reply or apologies.

I would not recommend using MoAfrika Tours, just book the lodge yourself, nearly every lodge and hotel offers transfers. No need to book through MoAfrika or any other operator."
Irritated,AU,Visited: March 2015,27-Mar-15,35-50,2-5 safaris,Ancient Wild Safaris,1,"A ridiculous, unprofessional organization","Where oh where oh where do I start to explain the ridiculous experience I had with this god-awful company.  It should be noted to that one of the good reviews posted on here was actually posted months later and from Kenya so that's a lack  credibility right there.

 I found ancient wild safari's right here on Safari bookings and after writing off to about 6 to 7 operate is looking for a certain itinerary that fit into a certain period of time I landed on this company. At the beginning Michael was very very good about returning my messages and seem to have his stuff together. They didn't have as many reviews as another company I was considering but sometimes I like to try to give the new guys a chance as I know how ihard it can be in business. I found his photo on Facebook and thought he looked very pleasant and like a nice African man. Even when I looked at other companies after I had already somewhat committed to taking the tour through Michael I felt a little bad as I don't like to mess people around.  There was a tour I really did like the look of better but I thought you know what let me give these new guys a chance as they hadn't done it that long from what I could tell a couple years versus many. 
I spent the first day in Nairobi with Morris a private driver arranged by Michael.  He honestly looked very tired at the beginning but he was a good talker and we got along. I was booked to do a group tour with African budget safaris for the first couple of days and then they hooked me up with a sister company in Tanzania as federal regulations prohibit the same tour operator operating in both states.  You're actually required to do part of your tour and then you get put on the shuttle bus down to Arusha where the sister company picks you up and you continue.  Morris and I had all day together and as the day went on he kept pushing me into doing a private Safari with just him and he kept stressing that I would have more flexibility. Finally at the end of the day back at the hotel we'll sit down together Michael Morris and myself. Michael said to me Morris thinks that you were very friendly lady he would like to take you want to private tour and share his love for Kenya with you and really a private tour would be much better for you so why don't you go ahead and do that. So I agreed and handed him the payment in full for the tour. He gave me a written receipt for the amount and then told me I would need to pay an additional US$300 give or take for the private version of the tour.  I didn't have enough money and I told him so and this we agreed I would pay after the tour. I did tell him he better make sure it's a great tour as I didn't want to pay extra if it wasn't. 

Morris arrives bright and early the next day. Again though he has these tired tired eyes and it was a little distracting so I asked him are you okay. He said yes. We get out on the road and as we're driving through out the day he tells me how a lot of Kenyans have a drinking problem but they all go out and drink a lot and it's a real problem. It didn't take long for me to put it together that he's tired bloodshot eyes were from a lot of drinking he was doing all night. We get to our first camp and it's quite satisfactory just outside the park Massai Mara. As promised my tent was a permanent self-contained and had its own bathroom with shower and toilet. I had specifically made sure I asked Michael in our email exchanges about these facilities and he told me that both Kenya and Tanzania had the same facilities that is self-contained tent with its own bathroom and shower. I was not willing to sign up with the company that did not provide these facilities and I was ready to pay more if need be but he assured me that these facilities were what I would get. Instead of going to dinner that night Morris decided to slip off into town and hit the bar and while he lied about it to me I'm not an idiot as my ex-boyfriend is an alcoholic and sometimes you can just tell the signs. I was a little put off that he didn't share dinner with me at the camp but I've heard different versions of what's considered appropriate and what's not.  The next day we got out on the Safari and sure know if there was an actual beer in the door of the car!!! I mean really people come on. By this stage we were in the middle of nowhere and even though I was in constant contact with Michael at this point I didn't want to mention it as I didn't want to be irritating Morris in the middle of the African bush when it was just him and me in the car.  Quite frankly he made me a little uncomfortable so what was I going to do I just had to get through it. So we get through the next couple of days and he smells and wears the same clothes one day as the night before when he picks me up but whatever. The same red tired bloodshot eyes the whole time so I just prayed. We end up in town and Michael is waiting at the shuttle bus to take me to Arusha and all that went okay. I get down to Arusha and get on Safari and that's all very well and fine but then we pull up at our first camp and I walking my little hut and guess what no bathroom no toilet no shower no self-contained nothing but a bed without sheets without anything.  Again I was assured it was self-contained which is very important to me. Oh it gets better the next night was actual camping sleeping on the ground in the pouring down rain and me with my bladder issues having to get out in the middle of the night with the water buffalo just 20 feet away from me and I had to pay right outside the tent in the middle of the night with rain gushing down on me and this is exactly what I wanted to avoid and therefore why I made sure to ask ahead of time would I have my own bathroom. It really did suck I have to tell you I woke up in the morning pissed off cold and miserable as I didn't get what I was told I would get I didn't get what I paid full and there's nothing worse than when you're lied to in business. I did let Michael know the night before the first camp that I was irritated and he told me please just be happy. This time I couldn't contact him as I didn't have any cell phone service. The actual scenery was amazing and made it worthwhile but really that's not the point right here. Finally I end up on the shuttle bus heading back to Kenya and he's waiting for me at the other end with Morris to pick me up and take me to this restaurant that's included as part of the whole tour. Morris gets out of the car to greet  myself and my new friends and actually staggers and crashes into the vehicle he is that wasted drunk!!!! I could not freaking believe it. I fought  with him the whole tour we were on together as  each night before we went to bed on tour I kept telling him don't get wasted drunk please please. With these early starts on Safari it's just not enough hours to get all the alcohol out of your system you know. Wasted drunk ridiculous oh my Lord. So I tell Michael hell no I'm not getting in the car with him he's drunk. Michael calls and all the driving and gets us to the hotel that is my friends and I. After we get there I proceed to let him know vigorously how unhappy I am with the alcoholism of the driver and the fact that I was lied to about my facilities in Tanzania and would you believe it he still tries to get the additional $300 out of me!!!!! I dig my heels in and say hello and my friends who actually United Nations offices all jump in and stick up for me as well. He fights vigorously until he gives up and leaves.  The next day I proceed to get all these threatening messages from him with verbal abuse telling me that no one on the tour in Tanzania liked me they thought I was a horrible person they thought I was stubborn,  I pissed everyone off.  Unreal and not true, we had fun and the company in Tanzania was really good, it's not their fault he lied to me and the service they provided had that been my expectation was more than satisfactory and I will give them a great review on here as they did their job very well and professionally.

As for Michael, not  once would  he knowledge that he lied his ass off to me even though the night before I had showed him all the emails we exchanged back-and-forth and I have witnesses that agreed with me that his communication with me clearly indicated I would have my own bathroom. I don't have to explain why I need my own bathroom it should just be enough that that's a request that I need honored. I get into it with him and tell him that I have a bladder issue and I had to go to the bathroom in the rain and then have no shower for three days because I didn't even have a towel because I was told my accommodation would be self-contained and he actually has the nerve to tell me that I should've told him about my personal bladder issue!!!!! Are  you freaking kidding me!!!!! It is no one's business what bladder issues I have can you talk about invasion of my privacy!!!!!!     He won't quit and tells me that not once did we actually stop at any accommodation that wasn't on the itinerary. Wow he just doesn't listen it was amazing as that was not my beef!!!!my beef was lying to me about the facilities not that we stopped anyway we weren't supposed to ....my Lord it was so aggravating trying to communicate with him.  He told me that I should've called him on tour to say I wasn't happy. Dude we were in the middle of the African jungle with no cell phone service are you really really serious. And not only that I did message him the first place we stopped when I realize the accommodations werent what he promised and all he said to me was please be happy please be happy the scenery is great and that's all. So I'm trying to get to the airport my last morning and he text me to tell me he's going to get the police to meet meet me at the airport and I broken the law and he's going to try to have me arrested and it was just ridiculous and even when I got to the Middle East he was texting me and calling me telling me he had my passport information he was going to the police at the airport he was going to go to the embassy and threatening me and it was just a complete circus. So if you read this far I beg you for your own sanity run fast from this company and save your money and yourself the aggravation of dealing with the most unprofessional, dishonest and ridiculous people I've ever met in my life. Oh and he even accused me of being racist , that was his defense. Yeah I'm racist and Id just come from volunteering at an orphanage where I spent time and money with all the kids because I'm racist and I have a black boyfriend because I'm racist. Fool . If there's any mistakes with grammar or punctuation in here it's because I talk text because I have a lot to say so if you actually want to verify that this is a true and legitimate review please don't hesitate to message me thank you."
Isabelle Niederberger,CH,Visited: December 2019,14-Feb-20,20-35,first safari,Kalahari Marsh Safari Holidays,1,It ended in a court case,"I had a few days of meetings in Botswana and booked two Safaris with Lucky, one before the meetings and one after. In the first  Safari (4 days) everything was ok. Moremi of course is a wonderfull place. The guide and the chef did a great job - all of them are freelancer. After the second safari (see further down), I am not sure they will work with Lucky again.
A much worse experience was the second safari (it should have been 7 days CKGR and Nxai Pans). Lucky didn¢®?t do any advance preparation for the trip like buying food or booking  accomadation in the parks. When the safari started he was not in Maun, but in Gabarone, an unexpected meeting he said. 
He sent the guide to pick me up, but didn¢®?t provide him with money for food, disel or accomodation. With the help of a friend of Lucky we could buy the most necessary things. Even I cashed in some money I had on me. Lucky said he would join us after two days and bring the required supplies. He didn¢®?t. He only showed up after three days, probably when he realized, that our situation wasn¢®?t too good: we were in CKGR, no food left and not sure we had enough disel to make it back to the gate, where we could have a phone call for support.
So he briefly came to our camp with more supplies, appologized, said from now on everything would work fine. It didn¢®?t. When we went over to Nxai Pans we realized: he did not pay park entrance nor accomadation for us - eventhough before hand he had repeatedly confirm that he did...
Before more people had to cash in money for something Luckey had been paid for by me in advance we headed back to Maun, two days early. Back in Maun we waited on Lucky. And he kept on with the scheme of telling that he would be there and then not showing up. He finally showed up when I set an ultimatum and threatened with the police. We then agreed on the money he had to refund me for the two days of safari that didn¢®?t happen and I also set the condition that he would pay the guide and chef for their work in order for me to consider the thing to be ok. He than set off, saying he would go to the bank to get the money - only to hide somewhere and play on time until I had my flight back home.
Until now, he did not pay the refund to me nor did he pay the money he owns the guide and the chef for their work. And I must say both of them did a great job, doing their best for me to have at least some safari!
Given the fact that Lucky owes money to all of us, the guide went to court with the case. We are waiting.
After this I wouldn¢®?t trust Lucky. He studied communication and he is good at telling stories. I assume he run into financial problems. This should not happen, he should not have used the money I paid to him for something else than my safari. But even if so, once it happened, he should not tell stories as he did. Very disappointing.
If you still book with Lucky, do not pay more than 1/3 of the money in advance, like this you make sure there¢®?s money left for your trip.

Italo Ch.,ES,Visited: August 2019,03-Sep-19,35-50,first safari,Planet Africa Safaris,1,"Lost 50% of our game drive time at Serengeti. When called Planet Africa for help, they could do noth","Planet Africa Safari organized our trip. They proposed us to go in north Serengeti to the ""Luxury"" Mara
Mara Lodge of TANGANYKA WILDERNESS CAMPS.

Planet Africa Safari never informed us that the Lodge was 1 hour away from the river where all the action
and animals are, and even less informed us that the lodge chain is on a complete much much much
lower level than the others Asilia Lodges we were. Lower in everything: lodges, food, cars, drivers and
managers.

They completely ruined our holiday, see below the details.
When called Planet Africa for help at the lodge, they could do nothing.
We are claiming to Planet Africa a partial refund for all the mess the Lodge driver and managers did to
us.

DO NOT TRUST PLANET AFRICA SAFARI SUGGESTIONS OF LODGES AND DRIVERS!!! .If
something goes wrong, is entirely up to you to solve it.

---DETAILED NARRATION---:
We arrived at Kogatende Airstrip with our pack lunches from our previous Lodge, our Asilia driver
organized us to have them so we could profit the whole day upon our arrival in Serengeti. Alex, the driver
we got assigned, tricked us and suggested us to go back to lodge for lunch at 13:00, and stay there till
16:00 before going back to river again: he said because animals hide when is hot and we would not see
them. And we were so stupid to believe him.
We wasted half of our days there before realizing we were being tricked by an extremely lazy driver
whose only goal was to have hot lunch at 13:00 o'clock and a little ¢®¡Æsiesta¢®¡¾ everyday.
We realized the trick when we were HUMILIATED, being the ONLY table having lunch at the Lodge the
second day of our stay, while at dinner there were like 30 persons. I have never felt so stupid in my life.
When we asked the driver to leave immediately after lunch, he started negotiating with me, that he
needed some allowance, that were many hours and so on.
We then decided to ask for a drive change to the managers of the lodge while at lunch. Managers let the
diver came to our table. The driver insisted with us like 20 minutes to give him a second change. I could
not had lunch. No manager was there, extremely violent situation.
We insisted on the change of driver and managers punished us making us stay 2 hours at the
Kogatende airstrip waiting for a new driver to come. They sent us without telling us that would be 2 hours
wait.
2 long hours at Kogatende airstrip, with full afternoon sun, on an open car without A/C, with kids,rounded
by tse-tse flys, while paying $$$ for a luxury Lodge with swimming pool. That's crazy!. We had to make a
denounce at the police at Kogatende airstrip, see attached photo of the text.
We lost half the time of our stage at north Serengeti because of this incredible problems, and we were
humiliated in an unbelievable way: first by the lazy driver tricking us, second by the managers backing up
the lazy driver and making us stay 2 hours at the airport waiting for the new driver, and third by the lodge
employees when at dinner they put us at a table right next to where Alex the driver we just changed
was.So that we could hear his loud comments and laughs.

Unbelievable.

Iv?n Redondo,ES,Visited: October 2017,22-Dec-17,20-35,first safari,Bush Baby Calls,1,VERY BADLY SERVICE!! MANAGED BY AN INCOMPETENT MANAGER!!,"Our dream began on October 23 but soon it turned into nightmare. We were a group of 6 persons to a safari of 13 days with this company and felt deeply defrauded specially for his manager, Mogakolodi Serumola, an authentic liar and swindler. I am sorry to say it this way, but it took us show restraint, it changed his camps, deprived us of games drives and it never faced the consequences. Always it was hiding and evading responsibilities. It is not possible to treat the people who pays of the form that this person did. This company should not be promoted without a supervision thoroughly. I have done already many safaris in Africa and it had never lived not equal at all. In a evening game drive safari we could not sleep in our camp because the guide was not finding it and ended up by sleeping six members of the group in a floor of a small boma of the local women without food or water and the manager was never facing the consequences he nor returned to us the money paid for the not received services in spite of the fact that he said to us that it would do it. One defrauds total."
Ivette Mendoza,MX,Visited: October 2021,07-Jan-22,35-50,first safari,Mufasa Tours and Travels,2,Poor experience,"We didn¢®?t have a good experience with this tourist operator.
First they offer a guide Spanish spoken and it wasn¢®?t true, the guide just know some words in Spanish so our communication was so complicated.
We bought the safari 5 day, in the service description they include two days safari at the Masai Mara (including some hours at the 5th day) and our guide said, no the last day is just for go back to Nairobi, we had to show him the description of the service to had the complete service."
Ivor,UK,Visited: May 2019,13-May-19,65+,over 5 safaris,Manna Expedition & Safaris Ltd,2,Stressful experience for our 6 th Safari to Tanzania as Peter Malinda had clearly got serious financ,"We. Travelled with two friends for their 1st and our 6th Safari in Tanzania. Peter Malinda had been an excellent guide with our previous Safari Company and we decided to support his company. All was well on arrival but we discussed a visit to Arusha National Park whist staying for our first day in Dilutu Lodge Arusha, this did not occur.Travel to Ngorongoro plus a Crater tour the following day was fine.
When we reached the gate to the Serengeti we discovered Peter had not payed the Park fees. After two hours of his failure to transfer payments to the Park Authories we paid over 500 USD by Visa. The next two days were only half day Safari trips asPeter wished to visit a tented lodge he. Had set up near te Seroners river, which was having problems.On our return trip to Manyara he stopped at Serengeti Airport as we found our payment had only covered one day Park fees and a further 1000 USD was required to cover the remaining two days. 6 hours of stress at the airport, including the attendance of the Police finally found Peter arranging money transfer to the Parh Authorities. He then drove like a man possessed to the Serengeti gate where we were told we could not cross the Ngorongoro Conservation Area until a further 350USD was found. After one hour Peter was unable to raise this money so we paid again by Visa. We arrived at Manyara in the dark at 8.30pm instead of the planned 1.00 pm. We had eaten nothing from breakfast. That mornings d missed the afternoon Manyara game drive.
The following day we returned to Diluti Lodge.
Peter then failed to pick us up at the agreed time and we had to pay a further 100 USD fora taxi to the airport.
Peter Malinda had received full payment for all hotels and Park Fees etc. In early March.He told us he would pay back the money we spent to the Parks but this has not occurred.
This trip became a disaster, anxiety inducing experience from what seemed to us a fraudulent company having clearly used a part of our payment for other than the arrangements for our Safari."
Ivy,US,Visited: April 2023,08-May-23,35-50,first safari,Go Touch Down Travel & Tours,1,Don't use go touch down,"Wow, what a waste.  Go touch down leaves you in the dark and wastes your travel time.  We had a tour the day we arrived in S. Africa and were never given a time or location.  Come to find out they never scheduled it.  We had to call at 11pm US time to get information.   The guide never knew he was taking us, so luckily he checked his messages.  None of the guides had information about any flights til the night before departure, and the tourists did not have their flight information either.  The tour guides were great, but Go Touch Down is worthless when it comes to collecting information or getting problems fixed.  Another huge issue was the flights to and from Victoria Falls.  We were unable to schedule our own flights and we spent 2 of our last 4 days in an airport.  They claimed there were no flights available any other time, that they were afraid a later flight would be cancelled, and that we were given options, all of which were false.  They don't realize we were in a group we stayed in contact with and they had the flights we tried to change to.  We had to stand around for several hours before we could even check our bags, then we were stuck in the airport for 4 hours.  It was 9 hours total between when landing and catching our next flight, information they knew and requested.  They attempted to fix it with a tour, but that's not what we got.  Someone picked us up at the airport, drove us 45 min. and dropped us off at a mall in Johannesburg telling us to go find a place to eat.  That is something we could have done at the airport.  We were also misinformed about Victoria Falls and not informed about tours that were available.  I have never had such a disorganized vacation with such unlimited information."

The driver , and he didnt take us to see the migration. It happened the 4th of August. Later, a person who was in Masai Mara that day, said me that all tourists were seeing the migration. Instead it, he ""sell"" us a ""walking"" to see Mara river. the price (the tip) was 5 dollars. Besides, he was very dangerous driving."
J & J,ZA,Visited: March 2015,18-Jan-16,35-50,first safari,Elkan Safaris Ltd,1,"A disorganized, dishonest and dishonorable company. Run away as fast as you can!"," I usually don¢®?t write negative reviews as most of my traveling experiences have been positive up until now.  I used this company as a recommendation from a friend who previously  booked and had a marvelous climb with Kunda (mountain guide). Despite reading just mediocre reviews we booked with Elkan Safari.  We booked both a 4 day safari/ Kilimanjaro climb w Kunda Kilimanjaro guide). The cost was all inclusive w gate prices but the end of tour the owner ripped us off an additional $460 usd. The original price was all inclusive, including entrance fees  but as we went along with itinerary there were several ¢®¡ÆSurprise costs¢®¡¾ along the way. Stranded at the gate w crew and other tour guest we were basically forced to pay beyond agreed amount.  We confronted him several days prior to departure about error, he confirmed to meet us to refund money. He did not show up, was unreachable and did not fulfill the rest of the itinerary leaving us stranded for a place to stay.  The kicker and deal breaker for me is not only did he not pay us our outstanding $460, but he not to pay the climb team or bus driver upon returning from climb leaving exhausted men stranded with no money after 7 grueling days of hard work. It is one thing to cheat and hustle tourists, but it is a whole another thing to cheat your own people and employees. These men practically killed themselves climbing up and down difficult Mt. Kilimanjaro w 23+ kg of supplies each on their heads.  They left their families and home for 7 day and received no pay. That is the ultimate low.  Victor Goodman, owner of Elkan Safari, Ltd, lied and stole from his clients and employees. Stay away from this company and his other listings Kilimanjaro Champion. As of today, he still hasn¢®?t paid his employees or the money he owed to us. Truthfully there are literally hundreds of companies out there for safari and mountain climbs so why take a chance with one that clearly has a reputation for ripping people off!!!

 On a positive note,  porters and mountain guides contracted, Kunda & Omary were simply magnificent. They took care of us and helped us reach the top!!! They salvaged our ruined holiday by making our climbing experience once in a lifetime. Kunda and Omary (mountain guides), went upon and beyond and assisted us when Victor left us stranded and them salary-less. They even met us the following day to make sure we made it out of Arusha safely to our next destination. We are forever thankful to them.

Jaime F,ES,Visited: September 2023,02-Oct-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Apodiformes Adventures,2,Can't trust Silas,"Sadly I have to agree with some of the reviews about Apodiformes Adventures.

During the hiring process, Silas, the owner of Apodiformes replied to my messages right away, adapting to our needs and promising an exceptional quality of service.

Being our honeymoon, we hired a safari considered luxury (over 4000 EUR for 5 nights), requesting booking at very specific accommodations. 

Until we formalized the reservation (transfer of 40% of the total) evething was fine. Once the payment was done the problems started to show up. The most wanted accomodation, Enkewa in Masai Mara, did not accept the reservation for not complying with their conditions (minimum 3 nights stay and take care of safaris in Masai Mara). Silas lied that they knew the accommodation and had previously worked.

The alternative was Olengoti Eco Camp, this accommodation has two types of room, tent and bungalow. The bungalow was requested (and paid for). Upon arrival at the Camp, the staff informed that our booking was at the inferior category and that they had no availability to manage the changeo of room. Silas lied again saying that the fault came from the camp (they showed me the booking made from Apodiformes) and that all rooms had the same price.

The third day of safari we had an incident with the car, we were standing 6h waiting for the repair. The guide asked us to take it easy and ask us to eat/drink in the cafeteria that the agency would cover. This never happened, not only that, Silas knowing the issue never got in touch with us in the whole week to check how things were going. We lost one day of safari and he didn't even care.

In the agreed itinerary, later that day we had a stop at Tompson Falls for lunch. We had to argue with the guide because Silas had not informed him and did not want to stop or pay the tickets.

With all the above being said, the overall experience was very good, thanks to John (our great guide) and the staff of the camps/lodges, but I would never hire them again for the lack of honesty and service provided by Silas.
It may be slightly cheaper than other companies but the price difference does not justify having to be constantly alert, feeling cheated and with the sensation that if there had been any problem the agency would not have helped or solved anything."
jake,BH,Visited: December 2015,24-Dec-15,50-65,first safari,Kilimanjaro Champion,1,Avoid at any cost!,"While the web-site gives the impression of a real company with full stuff and an office, providing well-planned service to the tourists,  this is very far from what we have experienced during our trip
 Mr. George Nagol was very attentive during the initial stage when we interacted over E-mail, but once the money had been paid he essentially disappeared and did not answer any of the questions except saying that everything is ready for us. 
In fact, when we have arrived to Arusha nothing was ready for us. Our first two days were completely ruined because the ¢®¡ÆCompany¢®¡¾ did not provide adequate transportations so one the first day we could not make a trip it to the Masai village (for which we paid $300) because ¢®¡¾the road was bad¢®¡¾ and on the second day when we were supposed to do a short trek at 3000m ($600) the van provided by the company (which did not have a 4 wheel drive) got stuck in the mud and instead of trekking we had to push it uphill in the rain. We did not do our trek and got no apologies.
The things got only worse on Day 4 when we went for a hike about 200km from Arusha and were expected to be picked up be a vehicle assigned to us by Mr. Nagol at 1PM. The vehicle was supposed to drive us to the airport to take a flight to Lake Victoria (already paid) The vehicle did not show up on time ? and we could not reach either Mr. Nagol nor the driver on the phone. Eventually we made it on foot to the camp where we waited until darkness descended (no light!) and still not being able to make contact with Mr. Nagol. We did contacted the driver and he gave us very elusive answers ? first that the vehicle broke down then that  he was driving someone else. As it turned out Mr. Nagol has sent the driver with other tourists to NgoroNgoro Park thus getting paid twice for the same service. The driver did show up at 7.30 PM with a vehicle full of passengers, drove like a madman and got us into the accident ? only the side mirror was destroyed but a few inches to the right and it would have been a full head on collision at 900mph! 
Despite fast driving, we missed the flight and thus the whole trip to Lake Victoria for which we have paid in full. Once again ? no apologies!
When we have changed the plans and just decided to drive to Serengeti our misadventures did not end.  The car kept breaking down on the hourly basis. A lot of time had been wasted. But far worse than that ? at the Serengeti park we had to pay the park fees ($240) on our own since according to the driver the company credit card had no money on it. We were promised a refund and of course did not get it. When we got back to Arusha Mr. Nagol avoided meeting us in a hotel and made up many stories about why he can notget money. In fact we are sure that Kilimanjaro Champion is a one man operation with no office or employees engaged in defrauding the tourists. 
While with all our negative experiences we had returned home in one piece, it is only a matter of time before something infinitely more serious happens when unsuspecting tourists like us entrust their fate to Kilimanjaro Champion, especially if they decide to do some serious climbing.

When the truck arrived it was noticeable one of the oldest Safari Trucks and the inside was not very comfortable.

First, take a look at the reviews he has on TripAdvisor, Google, and SafariBookings. Pretty impressive review scores. But take a closer look at the reviews themselves. Do many of them appear fake? Are they written mostly by reviewers with only one review, written by other local safari operators and/or have poor grammar? Are some of them written by ¢®¡ÆRama Mo¢®¡¾ himself pretending to be a customer?

Our first clue that something was amiss was when we tried to find the office that Rama claims to have. He told us specially what building his office was in (it¢®?s also marked on Google maps in this prestigious location). The office does not exist.

Once we realized this, we asked to see the car that was ¢®¡Æbeing repaired¢®¡¾ as part of his story. This was the night before we were to leave on our trip. During the trip to see the car (which was honestly bring repaired as described, but based on its condition did not appear ready for departure the next day) we talked casually to him about our trip and how excited we were (that it was our honeymoon). 

One hour after he returned us to our hotel, he sent a group WhatsApp text including an unknown person saying that his ¢®¡Æbusiness partner¢®¡¾ (really just one of his drivers posing as his ¢®¡Æpartner¢®¡¾) was unsatisfied with the price Rama has agreed to and that the trip (which was to start the next day) would be 3x more expensive!! When I protested that we had agreed to a price weeks ago (Rama had gone so far as to specify what kind of USD bills to bring and I had sent him a picture of the bills laid out on a table), they refused to even acknowledge the deal they had agreed to. It was clear that they decided to take advantage of the information we had given them ? that we were on our honeymoon- to try to extort us for 3x the price. How messed up is that?! The trip is now ruined and Rama has been increasingly dishonest in trying to justify this 3x price increase (we¢®?re talking about thousands of dollars). It¢®?s actually been quite embarrassing as Rama has repeatedly made new claims and I just keep responding with a screenshot of previous messages he sent contradicting his new lies.

The first 3 Days in Masai Mara with the Mara sopa lodge for 2 nights and 1 Night in Lake Nakuru NP at the Lake Nakuru Lodge.

Unfortunately we did not get what we booked.
We get a tent camp as an alternative for the overbooked Mara sopa lodge. It wasn't the same standard! Mara Sopa Lodge is much more expensive and we get no money back.

On the 3rd day was a 3-hour game drive according to our booking confirmation. But we only get a 2-hour game drive. On the way to the lake nakuru we had lunch and the driver droped us off with the message, we have to wait for another driver. After 3 hours we were finally picked up!!!
But now it was toooo late for the afternoon game-drive at lake nakuru, because we arrived there around 7 pm.

During the whole stay was promised us according to booking confirmation free water to each meal. 
At dinner in the camp/lodge there is no water include! To every dinner we had to pay for water!

When we told all these things to the tour organizer, they said that we should not make a mountain out of this and said, that??'s not their fault because of the free water. We should take water from the car to the hotel to drink this during dinner.

In summary, we can recommend this safari-tour in any case, but the tour operator would have to act somewhat more customer-friendly.

So instead of planned hike last 3 days was rush and run on the mountain.. Ongoing safari was OK, instead of vehicle in very poor condition, even for african standards.

It may be better at a different time of year or with a different guide. We did not mind the drive to Hwange from Victoria Falls. We had a very nice driver, but the guide that we had for the game drive was not very good and our vehicle was so noisy that we did not see much except for animals running away. All the animals that we did see were from a distance. It was suppose to be a full day game drive, but it basically ended at lunch time. At lunch time, we drove a long distance (at a very fast rate of speed over a very bumpy road) to the Kennedy Picnic Site. Once there we had lunch while fighting off the many bees and trying to keep them out of our drinks. After lunch, we got back in our game drive vehicle and headed out. We were thinking that we would be seeing more game, but again we drove a very long distance at a fast rate of speed and found ourselves back at the main camp and our game drive was over. Very disappointing."
Janine,UK,Visited: March 2017,24-Oct-17,35-50,2-5 safaris,Tanzania,2,Beautyful senic and an impressiv wildlife. Kilimanjaro is a memorable experience. I am very exited.,"The wildlife was really exiting. I saw many animals in the nature. I also climbed the Kilimanjaro. This was one of my best experiences I ever did so far. It is really impressive and also a real test for your body and mental skill. I really suggest to you to do this.
On the other hand I realised that you as a Tourist are just enough to pay a lot of money for a safari and not to get really the value for this. I booked with openafricasafari.com and the Price was much to much for this i got. In the same group were 6 other people who paid around 600 dollars for a 3 days safari. (I was booked on a group with maximum of 6 people and I was the 7th person!). The first 2 days was great. The second was so so. But my last day was worthless. A nature walk on the road. Walking straigt to a lake and than the same way back. How boring. Really not an experience. They sold me a nature walk!!!! They promised me to visit a School an a Hospital. We did not. I got some explanation about how bananas grow and so on. But a normal Person knows this already. The guide came to late in morning and was very surprised that I could walk for 3 hours and I did not call for a taxi, which, of course I would have to pay for it. (all the stupid Tourist are just rich and pay all the time!) Furthermore I had to tell the guide what we gonna visit. Otherwise we would have been back to the Hotel very early.  I really paid around 200 dollars to much for this trip. I would not book whith this agency again.
The 3. day. The other 6 persons booked only 3 days. So the guide wanted to leave the game park at mid day. But I booked a full day in this game reserve. Even the others ha in there itinery that they would stay until 3 o'clock. Finally the guide turned around an we continued the game drive. But the day was not good anymore.

It is a shame to treat Tourist like this. Tansania is just a nice country and I met so many good guides on my 2 month journey trough south africa. 
I was travelling for 8 weeks with other different tour guides (south africa, Namibia, Botswana and Tansania)and it always was a very good experience. Only the safari with openafricasafari fucked up. I asked for same money back, but,,,,,"

Jascha,DE,Visited: February 2023,11-Mar-23,35-50,2-5 safaris,Selous Kinga Lodge,1,Terribly organized safari tour (2-day fly-in/out Safari from Dar),"Terribly organized and chaotic tour, contact persons gave out contradictory information, horrible game-drive, many useless phone calls, dirty sleeping room full of millipedes, lodge staff friendly and food OK, taxi driver dropped me off at the wrong terminal to get the flight and later at the wrong hotel after the tour. I made very good experiences with other tour operators in Tanzania, so that I need to recommend: Do NOT book at Selous Kinga Lodge. Further details below:

I requested an offer for the ¢®¡Æ2-day fly-in/out Safari from Dar¢®¡¾ via Safaribookings.com and was directly linked to Edward and Martin from the lodge who helped me to clarify first questions regarding the tour and send me the offer for the tour. 

As soon as I had placed the down payment the trouble began. Martin called me several times. I did not have the feeling, that there was a language problem during the calls, however, almost no useful information was exchanged. 

Taxi Pickup to and from the hotels, where I stayed before and after the safari tour were organized by Martin. I sent him the names and addresses of the hotels via Whatsapp. The taxi driver to bring me to the airport dropped me off at the wrong terminal, so that I almost missed my flight to start the safari. The flight was booked by Martin, so that he should have communicated to the driver were to bring me.

The taxi diver to bring me back to the hotel dropped me off at the wrong hotel. When I gave him the right address, he did not know, where it was, although I shared hotel names and addresses with Martin already weeks in advance.

I made the down payment for the tour already three months before tour start. In January Martin explained me, that he could only give me the flight tickets 4 days before departure, because it would be last minute tickets and there were not enough booked passengers on the plane, yet. At the end, the plane was full of tourists and the other tourists told me, that they have received the confirmation for the tour and the flight several months in advance. 

The flight with Auric air itself was a great experience: New planes, friendly staff, great views out off the plane. 

Edward explained me via email, that it was fine to pay the rest payment directly at the lodge. However, Martin called me only a few days before tour start, that I need to pay everything upfront. Because of that, I needed to give the money in cash to the taxi driver, who brought me to the airport. He could not give me any receipt or payment confirmation.

The game drive in Nyerere Park was horrible. The driver drove at full speed in direction of the animals so that in most of the time we were only able to see the backs of frightened creatures. Bushes and small trees were destroyed when they were run over by the car. Out of the driving car it was generally difficult to take pictures and good positioned stops were very rare.

When I entered the sleeping room, there were around 10 millipedes with a length more than 100 mm inside. I pushed them out, but when I came in the next time the were new ones inside. I understand, that the Lodge is in the middle of the nature. But I slept in comparable locations, where the sleeping rooms, tents or cabins were very clean from the inside.

Do not book at Selous Kinga Lodge. Choose one of the good alternatives.

Jason,UK,Visited: August 2019,22-Sep-19,20-35,first safari,Hyrax Safaris,2,Outsourced to another operator that provided poor service; bad client service after paying money.,"The review is a bit lengthy but please read in full.  I booked a 3-day shared tour in Masai Mara from 10-12Aug with 7 other travellers.  Tour is operated by Bencia Africa Adventure & Safaris (I wasn't informed of this whatsoever until boarding the van).

Pre-touragreed on 2-person tent on SMS with Roselyne who had a friendly tone.

Day 1Was picked up at 8:30am as scheduled and arrived at office at 9am to get into an uncleaned safari van.  Other travellers were told to arrive at the office at 8am, meaning they had to wait for 1 hour pointlessly due to tour operator's poor arrangement.

Arrived at Miti Mingi Eco Camp, waited for 10 minutes, no reception at all and of course no room plans.  Had the evening drive and returned to the camp at 630pm.  Had a 30-minute wait for dinner, during which the tour guide did not give information on room and meal arrangements until we searched for him around the Camp.  After dinner, waited for 1 hour to ask for information ourselves by searching for Camp manager / tour guide / etc.  At 9pm, Camp manager said the camp is overbooked and asked me and another male traveller to stay in a 4-person tent (with 2 other people), and said ""will talk about other things the next days"".  The other 6 travellers (1 man 5 women) were driven for >15min to another lower-quality campsite.

Day 2Tour guide gave minimal explanation of animals (total talking time <15min).  Definitely not the best guide as Roselyne described, despite his ability to follow other vans to spot the big 5.  Visit to Keekorok Lodge was great.

At the Camp, we found the Camp manager for refund arrangements given the inconvenience and no 2-person tent as agreed due to overbooking.  He argued he delivered his services because we spent a night at his tent.  He refused to provide refunds because he claimed only the tour operator (Bencia), not the travellers, are their customers.  His attitude was poor despite we the customers kept calm.

That night, my roommate and I stayed in the same 4-person tent (with no other people).  Note that 4-person tents has worse facility and sanity levels compared to 2-person tents that other travellers stayed in.

Day 3Had an early morning drive.  We weren't informed by the driver of when and where the van will stop for lunch during the drive back to Nairobi.

Went to Bencia's office to complain the above issues and asked for some refunds.  Bencia said they need to discuss internally for 2 days and will inform me of the decision.  No follow-up since then.

Messaged Roselyne to complain politely.  She said ""There is no refund!  You never slept outside.  You ate and used water in the camp.""  ""We don't refund clients after they have done a safari and feel like they need their money back.  This is fraud!"".  No reply on messages sent over various days afterwards.

Fraud or not, my fellow travellers, it's your decision.

ttdrdidn't understand the overwhelmingly good reviews of Hyrax Safari and Roselyne."
Jason Turner,AE,Visited: November 2015,22-Nov-15,35-50,2-5 safaris,Matoke Tours,1,Disappointed with tour organization and transportation issues,"My partner and I did a 4 day Gorilla Tour in Uganda and while I would like to say the tour was great, I just can't it was filled with disappointment from Matoke Tours..

Our driver David was a good driver, and drove sensibly throughout the very long drive. However my partner and I didn't really know what was going on. David's communication with us and the other 4 tour guests that traveled with us was a bitter disappointment. He failed to give us any detailed itinerary of the day.... Yes he was only the driver but when you pay a lot of money for a trip of a lifetime I do expect some professionalism with all staff from reputable tour company.
It gets worse though.
We asked our driver to drop us off at Entebbe Airport along with another guest (so 3 of us travelling to airport) instead of going to Kampala and then going to Entebbe which can add another 1.5 hours to 2hours. The driver said he could drop us off and a Taxi would pick us up to take us to the airport. No mention of cost or price here. So one would assume that cause our driver didnt want to drive via Entebbe that Matoke should accomdate us and include this in our tour cost which was $1890 USD for the two of us.
When we got dropped of at the pickup point the taxi driver had been waiting for us for over 2 hours. We were then shocked that he was told to tell us the cost is $40 USD to take us to the airport from there. Which was a crazy price. We paid $23 USD from Entebbe airport to Kampala when we arrived, they charging over double the price and it was 15km shorter distance. We refused to be extorted like this and so the driver then called Eric one of the managers from Matoke to say we wouldnt pay that. He dropped the price to $30 USD which we had no choice to accept, it was late and we had been driving for 12 hours. When we got to airport I got driver to call Eric back and I spoke to him directory and said how unhappy I was with the situation and very disappointed and there lack of communication. He promised he would have someone email me the next day to recity the situation..... now 5 days later and nothing. Just confirms the type of company you are dealing with. You pay a lot of money and then they are trying to rip you off with a taxi.... Transport should really be included, pick up and drop off. Dont try and rip people off to make a few dollars so you can benefit more for tours that already cost us a lot of money.

The Gorilla Tours with the rangers at the National Park was perfect. But it should be and this part of the tour actually had nothing really to do with Matoke Tours as you get dropped at the national park and do the Trek with the rangers and scouts.... This part was great.. The Accommodation and the dinners we had was also amazing.

However the driver and logistics issues left a very sore taste in our month and really resent choosing Matoke Tours for our Gorilla Tour. My advice choose another company that has reliable communication."

We selected this company, Bush Baby Calls, because the price was good (Ultimately the cheap thing works out expensive) but our problems started in the first day in vic Falls when the manager of Bush Baby Calls received to us in the airport. He wanted only the rest of the money and then...he disapear!!
In short, we lost many breakfasts, lunches and dinner in spite of we pay for full board. Futhermore, the manager, Mogakolodi Serumola cheated on us several times: the land cruiser that we used was broken, he promise to us repair it however I didn??t it; we losed several games drives and he promised to us to do night games drives and we didn??t it, we pay to take shower inside the tent but he didn??t it, we had to apy the park fees in some parks and he told us that then he did the transfer to us but he didn??t it... The manager was terribe, a completely liar. Our safari was a full nightmare. I have done safaris in Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Zimbabwe and it had never suffered anything similar as with this company. His manager was a coward. He never help us.  In spite of the fact that in Khwai his driver left wire drawing us in the middle of the bush in the middle of the night and one was because he was not finding the camp.
If you want to enjoy a safari do not contract with this company.    "
Javier,ES,Visited: July 2022,17-Jan-23,20-35,first safari,Karumuna Safaris,1,"Stress, lies and nature","I booked (and paid) a Safari in 2019, which would happen in 2020, for 5 days including: chimps in Kibale, gorillas, climbing lions safari, and birding in Mabamba Swamp. 

Obviously, COVID came and we couldn't make the trip in 2020. Richard (the owner), said that it was OK and that we could postpone everything to 2021, but he wasn't able to return the money. 2021 arrived, and we were not yet vaccinated, so at first, we decided to go but then we postponed again. Richard said that it was okay, with no penalties for postponing to 2022.

2022 arrives and around April I start moving everything for July of that year. We fix the dates, I buy the planes and everything seems to be okey. A couple of weeks later, the first unpleasant surprise, Richard tells me that the gorilla permits have expired, and we need to pay again. Even though he was explicit on the opposite a year before. We were angry, but what could we do, we paid again. Starting from that date, I asked like 6 times during the coming months for an official itinerary of the Safari, with the specific dates and what was included. Richard didn't send anything. A week before going to Uganda, he sends me the itinerary, and it was wrong!! The gorillas were booked for the day I was supposed to leave the country. Imagine my stress, ONE WEEK EARLIER with no gorillas, because Richard told me even in April that we should book the gorillas right away because it gets sold out very very quickly. 

He said a couple of days later that everything was ok with the gorillas, but the chimps were not going to be in Kibale, but in Kalinzu. I paid 150$ for Kibale and the fee for Kalinzu was 45$. I didn't receive back any money. 

We arrive in the country. The planning (roughly) was:
1-. Arriving + Transfer to Chimps zone
2-. Chimps + boat trip
3-. Safari + transfer to gorillas
4-. Gorillas
5-. Birding + departure flight

First day, everything OK. 

Second day, chimps. We were alone in Kalinzu, I suppose because it's way worse than Kibale. Terrible surprise, Richard ask me on Whatsapp to borrow him 500$!!! Something about his mother. WTF I thought. Very angry, I answer him that no, I would not give him any money and he ask again for 100$! At that point, I was equally upset and surprised.

Third day. We arrive at Ishasha, and the guide tells us that the national park is closed because of an injured animal. I tell him that then what about the money that I paid for the entrance and how is it possible that an entire park closes without prior notification causing inconveniences to all the visitors. After insisting a couple of times, he said that we could try on the other entrance. We go to the other entrance, and after a couple of minutes of speaking with the people in the park, the guide comes out of the reception tent of the park with a soldier, and the soldier tells us that it was some elephant in the middle of the road that the veterinaries were healing. Big lie, and the soldier was for increasing credibility, I suppose. We arrive at the end of the day at Bwindi. The accommodation was super amazing, and because of that I was a little bit disappointed because we were supposed to start our day at 8 AM, but the guide eventually changed it to 9, and that hour in the balcony of the accommodation would have been amazing. 

When we were having dinner, another terrible moment. Richard WhatsApp me, telling me that we were not going to make it to the Birding because watching the gorillas + transfer to Entebbe is too much for one day. Obviously, I was mad again. I asked about the money, and he refused to give anything back. The only option we had is to drive a long long time during the night for arriving on time. This was a bad option because the driving in Uganda is crazy, and even worse at 2 AM with a guide that has driven for 10 hours already. 

Forth day. The guides make sure that we were with the group that would arrive quicker to the gorillas. Luckily, we saw the gorillas early and we started heading to Entebbe. We arrived at our very late in the night and we woke up at 04:30 to make it to the birding. 

Fifth day. Woken up at 04:30, went to the birding and then to the airport. End of the trip.

The guides made everything that was on their hands to make our trip comfortable, they drove uncountless hours and were very nice to us, but the owner is a very unprofessional person that made our trip very unpleasant for moments, so I can't recommend him."
Javier,OM,Visited: January 2017,23-Jan-17,35-50,2-5 safaris,Unison Safaris and Photography,1,Scam Tour Operator (works close with Arusha Police Department),"My wife and I were booked a 5 day Safari Tour with Felix Kisamo (owner of Unison Safari) from January 1 2017 to January 6 2017.

To everyone reading this reviews ""Do not book Unison Safaris"" for any reason, is a dangerous tour company runned by a man called Felix Kisamo who works close with the local police department of Arusha to get away with his scams. 
He will offer very good prices and promise you the time of your life but once you book with him he starts a ""game"" of lies asking always for more money.
We were scared for our lives as he picked us up from the airport (he didn't had money even to pay for the gasoline of the car he was driving us with) he told us he had lost all of our money because he kept it at his office which he said was robbed, we demanded him to go straight to the police and the detained him and explained that he has been doing this type of scams for quite some time (the police told us he was not robbed) and that he is full of personal debts and is spending the turists money who book with him to pay them but by doing so he doesn't fulfill what he agrees with tourist  as a tour operator (accomodation, guided, park fees, etc.). We spend a whole day at the police station as they tried to make him pay us all the money we had previously paid him (around $3,500 USD) and were only able to get $1,000 USD out of him (after he went with family members collecting money to pay us back), so we had to book with another tour operator having lost $2,500 USD.

We have nothing to gain by writing this other than helping future tourists from being scammed by Mr. Felix, we were also told that many positive reviews you see of him are part of the ""scam"" as he arranges with people to write them for him to lure more tourist to his scams.

In Tanzania we ended up paying for three Park entrance fees and stay at one camp. We had to pay out of pocket more than $9,000. Despite repeated requests and phone calls we have not received any money from them. They had verbally and by e-mails agreed to pay this amount in full. SO BE CAREFUL !! The Safari itself was excellent and the drivers were very good. It's the front office that lacks communication and make promises that they do not keep. "
Jayanti,AE,Visited: June 2023,02-Jul-23,35-50,2-5 safaris,Frena Adventures,1,Soured our hard earned vacation,"Fred and Eddie have managed to sour our hard earned trip to Rwanda and Uganda. 
I booked the 5 day mid-range itinerary with Frena. I sent our tickets to Fred as soon as i booked it (a month ahead of our trip), he ignored our flight time and added chimp tracking, which we only got to know, was never possible after meeting Eddie, the tour guide. He refunded the money but was so vague and indirect and not sorry about this and rudely told me to research pricing of the chim tracking.
The car was a very uncomfortable van, making the long drives uncomfortable and unsafe! the front seat snapped back multiple times on my husband¢®?s feet. Eddie never apologized, never did anything about it. Even the roof that was propped up for the game safari, came slamming down and thankfully we werent standing at that time, all because he forgot to engage the  safety lock and again, never apologized.
Eddie had no interest in communicating the plan of the day, change in plans, any delays etc, we just had to figure it out. Day 2, i asked him about lunch enroute and he told me we will have late lunch at the lodge, we reached at 5pm, and due to his communication mishap, they had not prepared lunch. All he said was ¢®¡Æwhy dont you have an early dinner by 6?¢®¡¾ No apologies again. 
The last day, he made us leave our lodge at 6:30 for a 6 hour drive, reaching the airport 5 hours before our flight (im sure he knew they dont even let you in) under the pretense that we may get traffic, when he actually wanted to get to Kampala sooner."

      but I am wrong! 
      The trip was very bad. I changed three cars and three drivers in a row on the road. I didn't have any notices or reminders before, which made me feel at a loss, and there was no apology and explanation afterwards, especially the last driver was not prepared any water for us and we were all thirsty and unbearable, and we couldn't buy any water. The most exaggerated thing was that the driver was unwilling to take me to the airport. The 7-day itinerary included the last delivery to the airport. He asked me to call Uber by myself!

Jeff,CD,Visited: July 2015,20-Oct-15,50-65,first safari,East African Safari & Touring Company,1,August 2015 Safari with Eastco ? Issues and Warnings,"My wife, Robin, and I recently returned from a 22 day (Aug. 6 ? Aug. 27) northern circuit safari arranged through Eastco. Being our first time in Africa I would like to thank all of the contributors here for the information they provided while I trolled around the forums researching and planning our trip. I¢®?ve been waiting to post this review while negotiating a refund with Simon King, owner of Eastco. 

First let me say that the Tanzanian people are wonderful to be around and the parks and animals are truly amazing. We never once felt unsafe or threatened in our travels. I believe our guide James was outstanding, not only did he find a ton of animals for us but he also imparted a tremendous amount of knowledge to us. He is also just a great person to be around.  

While we did have a ¢®¡ÆTrip of a Lifetime¢®¡¾ we both feel that it was in spite of Eastco and not because of them. The only good thing we can say about them is James. He was put in some tough situations by Simon and worked hard to get us the best experience possible. We booked with Eastco because Simon said he could provide everything we wanted in our itinerary and get us into the accommodations we requested while the other providers we talked to were hesitant on some things. Back in 2014 when we started the booking process there weren¢®?t as many negative reviews of Eastco as there seem to be now. After going with them for our safari my advice would be to find another company to book your trip through. The people, parks and animals of Tanzania are a given while the tour operator should enhance your experiences; however the failures by Eastco added stress into our trip. I only wish I could recommend James as a guide separate from Eastco. 

Here was our final itinerary as negotiated and agreed upon with Simon.  
day 1 - Evening arrival Arusha (jro) w/ overnight African Tulip Hotel
day 2 - Explore Arusha with EastCo Guide w/ overnight African Tulip Hotel
day 3 - Morning drive to Tarangire, afternoon game drive w/ overnight Tarangire Safari Lodge

day 21 - Morning walking safari along Sand River, w/ overnight Boundary Hill Lodge
day 22 - Morning transfer to Arusha, dayroom at Arusha Hotel, afternoon transfer to jro

Here is a short list of what failed to meet our expectations or didn¢®?t happen according to our itinerary.

day2 - Simon showed up late at the hotel for final payment, after which he called to let James know to
             stop by and pick us up. We didn¢®?t get started exploring Arusha until almost noon. 
day4 - Charged for additional (Un-purchased) Tarangire entrance permit.  
day6 - Accommodations changed without notice from the White Rose Guest House to The Winners Hotel.
day7 - Accommodations changed without notice from the White Rose Guest House to The Winners Hotel.
day7 - Accommodations changed without notice from the White Rose Guest House to The Winners Hotel.
            Cultural visit in Babati consisted of a walk around town.
day9 - Eastco made no reservation for us to stay at Tindiga Camp.
day10 - We had to pay Tindiga Camp fee ourselves even though we had already paid Eastco in advance.    
               Range Rover broke down and we were delayed for a few hours.           
day11 - Accommodations changed without notice from Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge to Wildlife Lodge.
               We had requested the Sopa Lodge specifically to allow an early morning start into the Crater.
               Eastco booked us into the worst room at Wildlife Lodge, directly under the dining area so we
               could hear all the chairs, tables and people moving about right over our heads.
day12 - No early morning start into the Crater as Eastco didn¢®?t pay for the permit until after 10:00.
              We didn¢®?t enter the Crater until 11:30 and were leaving by 1:30 including a lunch break. We
              only had 1 ¡§? hours in the crater an then because of the late start it was a mad dash to get out
              of Ngorongoro Conservation Area on the one 24 hour permit.
              Charged for additional (Un-purchased) Ngorongoro Conservation Area entrance permit.  
              Acquired Serengeti permit good for only one 24 hour period instead of all seven planed days.
              We specifically requested at the tented camps to be at the far end of the row away from the
              main gathering areas. We were put in tent number one right next to the dinning tent. 
day13 - Returned to airport twice to extend Serengeti permit for one extra 24 hour period
               because the first time there was not enough money on card. 
day14 - At lunch we were told that we would have to go back to camp, pack up and change camps
              because KatiKati was full and Eastco had only booked us for two nights not the three that we
              paid for. Only the efforts of the camp manager allowed us to stay, Eastco would have made us
              move. We both felt that the camp manager was working harder for us than Eastco. 
              Returned to airport to extend Serengeti permit for one extra 24 hour period.
day15 - On the drive to the Mara area we were told that we didn¢®?t have a place to stay yet but they
               were working on booking two nights each  at two different camp, not the four nights at
               Serengeti North Wilderness Camp like we had paid for. This meant an extra move in between
               camps. We stayed at Savanna Mara Camp. 
              Stopped at the airport to extend Serengeti permit for one extra 24 hour period.
day16 ? Accommodations changed from Serengeti North Wilderness Camp to Savanna Mara Camp.                
             Returned to airport to extend Serengeti permit for one extra 24 hour period.               
day17 - Had to pack up in the morning because of the change in camps.   
              Accommodations changed from Serengeti North Wilderness Camp to Kenzan Mara Camp.  
              Put into tent that smelled like it had a sewer leak.
              Returned to airport to extend Serengeti permit for one extra 24 hour period.  
day18 - Accommodations changed from Serengeti North Wilderness Camp to Kenzan Mara Camp. 
day20 - Range Rover broke down and was not fixable. We were stranded beside the road for several
               hours until a friend of James showed up to drive us onto our next destination while he
               stayed with the vehicle in order to get it repaired.            
day22 ? When James arrived to take us into Arusha the Range Rover had a broken motor mount so
               we had to drive very carefully back to town.  
               Eastco did not book a dayroom for us at the Arusha Hotel that we paid them for in advance.
               Simon was ¢®¡Æout of town¢®¡¾ and unavailable for a review of how our trip went or to reimburse us .

We feel one of the biggest failures was not being booked into the accommodations we requested and paid for in advance. This was one of the very reasons we chose Eastco because Simon said he would put us into the places we wanted to stay. By the end of the trip I got the feeling that they were waiting until the last minute to book our camps and trying to get the cheapest place they could find. It would explain why we almost got kicked out of KatiKati Camp, didn¢®?t get into Wilderness Camp, Ngorongoro Sopa Lodge, the White Rose and in general got such bad rooms and tent locations. We paid deposits more than a year in advance to reserve these locations and specific dates with payment in full being made before leaving Arusha so there is no excuse for our accommodations being changed without warning. Of course, worst of all was having to pay twice at Tindiga Camp. We paid Eastco in advance and then we had to pay again at the camp because of Eastco¢®?s nonpayment. Not only that, but we paid Eastco a markup for the privilege of paying twice. The uncertainty of where we would be staying each night definitely added stress into our trip.  

Another big failure, there was never enough money to pay for entrance permits. Again it seemed to be a day to day thing even though we paid the total amount to Simon in cash. This meant that we only got to spend 1 ¡§? hours in Ngorongoro Crater and while in the Serengeti our days were arranged around daily trips back to the airports to renew our permit. The constant permit renewal situation, never knowing if we were going to get into or be able to stay in a particular park just added a little more stress. Eventually we began questioning what experiences we were missing because of the frequent airport stops.

Now a few words about the general condition of the Range Rover we were in. But first let me say that I grew up in rural Oregon in a small logging town so I know what beat up trucks are like and what rough roads can do to them. I have ridden in and driven them my whole life. That being said, this vehicle was in terrible shape and ill equipped to send paying clients out in the bush for an extended trip. It only had one spare tire, no radio, no air conditioner and no shovel or any other recovery equipment. While the tires did have decent tread on them they were street tires not traction tires. Two of the four doors didn¢®?t open properly and neither did the tail gate. The weather seals around the doors, windows and tail gate were all in bad shape. This allowed dust to flow into the interior and coat everything inside including us, not to mention the constant rattling. The motor was so worn out that it had no power when pulling up even the smallest hill and the shocks were so weak that they could not control the wheel bounce on the wash boarded roads making for some long and rough travel days. I know this might sound like a lot of nit picking, but you spend the majority of your time in the vehicle so its condition is important. 
We first started noticing that every time there was a small hill the Range Rover would lose power, slow way down and a huge amount of black diesel smoke would pour out of the tail pipe. This became acute climbing up Ngorongoro from Karatu and then out of the crater the next day and it only seemed to get worse as the trip went along. I really didn¢®?t think it would last the entire trip. 

We had two break downs, the first occurred on the way back from Lake Eyasi to Karatu on Day10, one of the water hoses sprung a leak and the motor began to overheat. After some time James was able to make a bush repair and we were able to limp into Karatu where he fixed it properly the next day.
The second was on Day20 when we drove from Lake Natron back to Boundary Hill Lodge. Just after passing through Mto Wa Mbu the front pinion gear ate itself and locked up the differential. We were stranded along the road side until one of James¢®?s friends came to take Robin and myself on to Boundary Hill. We didn¢®?t see James again until the morning of Day22 when he showed up to take us to the airport. However as we loaded up James informed us that the Range Rover now had a broken motor mount so we would have to take it nice and slow on the way back to Arusha. We feel very lucky the breakdowns didn¢®?t happen far out in the bush because that would have left us stranded for much longer periods of time than we were.

Our biggest disappointment was that Simon didn¢®?t feel it was necessary to contact us once while we were on the trip to explain what was going on, nor did he feel compelled to meet with us afterwards. The uncertainty of Eastco¢®?s multiple failures added so much stress to our trip that it made it difficult at times to enjoy the incredible places we were traveling through. 
Upon returning home I¢®?ve been in email contact with Simon and negotiated a refund payment of $800 for all the things we were charged for but Eastco didn¢®?t deliver. It¢®?s been over a month now and all I get from him is one excuse after another. At this point in time I feel that I will not receive compensation for the over charges and forced double payments. Simon will tell you want you want to hear when you are planning a trip but he doesn¢®?t feel obligated in any way to deliver what he charges for. After considering everything that happened to us on our trip we feel that he is dishonest and someone we would never do business with again. If you have booked a trip through him good luck, if you are considering using him, don¢®?t.

I took the trip from Dar Es Salaam all the way down to Cape Town, with two different sets of stafftour guide, cook and bus driver. I can't say enough good things about the second part of the trip, from Victoria Falls to Cape Town. The campsites were beautiful, the food was AMAZING and our guide was extremely knowledgeable. However, the first few weeks of the trip were quite painful, due to our terrible tour guide. He was rude, talked back to customers, wouldn't tell us how long the bus trip would be, and openly mocked customers. My bag got stolen at one campsite (no one's fault at all!) and I couldn't find our tour guide to tell him, he was at the pub having a drink. When I did tell him, he simply kept saying that it 'was not possible' and refused to help in any way at all. I had to contact the reception team at ATC to get a letter (they were quick, sympathetic and professional.) 

Overall, my experience was good regarding the campsites, food, locations, and administrative staff. However our guide was so terrible for the first three weeks that it is impossible for me to give ATC more than two stars. :( If you are considering booking a tour, ensure that your tour guide is NOT Frances. I'm sure the rest of the guides are great, and this is just one bad apple. Ensure that Frances is not your guide before leaving. "

Everything went wrong, but I??ll try to keep it short. I had to pay a 50 % deposit by bank transfer so that a guy sometimes called Donald sometimes Daniel could make a reservation for a hotel. It cost me a fortune and as it turned out: nothing was reserved. I had to share not just a room, but also a bed with the other girl on the tour. Yes, two strangers in one bed! Daniel/Donald stayed in Daressalaam. The driver barely spoke english, but enough to tell us that his boss turned off his phone when we insisted on two rooms or on the pop up roof jeep we booked and payed for. We had to do the safari in a little Toyota. After the rain season the grass is so high that many times you can't see a thing. We never went too far away from the lodge since the car couldn't manage many of the bumpy roads without 4x4. Yes, sometimes we saw animals, but there was no real safari feeling. I am so disappointed. :("

Our problems were:
Dropped off for lunch on the first day, no driver came to pick us up. Restaurant staff helped us out, and after ringing our previous guide in Rwanda and her phoning Simon, a driver came after a couple of hours, but not the one Simon had told us to expect so the uncertainty began.

It was a once in a lifetime experience that this company continually tried to sabotage. I booked three months in advance to go to Tarangire, Serengeti, and Ngorogoro. When I arrived in Arusha, the manager Richard changed my itinerary so I never made it to Tarangire. Then, he tried to cut my Safari short by one day so we could drive a separate party to the airport. When confronted after the trip with these complaints, Richard was rude to myself and my family. He never even addressed our concerns as we attempted to talk to him in a calm manner. I later found out he suspended the driver for our trip, who was by far the highlight of the trip and pleasure to be around.

If you are looking to book a safari, just avoid this company. There are plenty of great companies out there operating similar safaris that there is no need to deal with Richard and the hassle of World Tours and Safaris."

Myself and my husband took a 6 day luxury tour using right choice safaris in December/Jan and had an excellent time. While the tour was as hoped, all accommodations were excellent and the driver very good unfortunately I have to leave this company a negative review as we were scammed out of thousands of dollars when making payment to this company for our tour. On arrival we were informed we needed to settle final payment I advised that we had already made final payment and had emails from them and confirmation from the bank, they then informed us that their email had been hacked and the person I had been communicating with and who I had transferred money to was not them. Unfortunately they informed us they had suspicions that this may be the case and neglected to contact us using another form of communication to inform us of this suspicion knowing that this had happened to them before when their email was hacked on a prior occasion. We were forced to make another payment at the office of $3000AUD. While they attempted to contact the bank to make amends we have unfortunately not at this stage been able to get our money back and I have no idea whether their email really did get hacked or whether they were part of the scam. If using right choice safaris I advise make payment at the office on arrival not via bank transfer. "

Broken equipment (chairs, sleeping bags with no zip, tents with holes), poor organization (3h lunch, no dynamism), risky behavior (the driver had no tent not sleeping bag so did not sleep for 3 days).
Very packed car with a lot of problems (motor, windshield, wheels).
We had to build ourselves the tents, waiting 4h for food, doing very few game driving with the guide who had no knowledge of the wild life and did not bother stopping to see animals.

When confronting them, they did not acknowledge the poor service provided, although we all paid 200$/day/pers. for a zero level safari service, moreover putting our lives in danger with risky behavior (driving fast, equipment on the roof not secured, one door broken etc.)

There are plenty other companies who will do a lot better with the same amount of money!"
Jessica,UK,Visited: November 2016,12-Dec-16,35-50,2-5 safaris,African Comfort Zone (ACZ safaris) LTD,2,miscommunication with a single traveler,"So first of all, I have been on 2 other safaris. This wasn't my first. 

So to begin, I chose ACZ because of their good reviews. Also, John was very communicative and helpful before I went. He answered all of my questions in a timely manner and seemed professional. I traveled as a single so I was nervous about this but John eased my fears.

I was supposed to stay at the Lenchada camp with the group but there was a mix up. I assumed John would have put me in a single since he knew I was traveling as a single. He did not. I didn't want to share a tent with strangers. It wasn't clear in our communication beforehand that I would be made to share a tent with strangers. In fact, they wanted to put me in a tent with 3 other people! No. I didn't realize this would be like a hostel. So they sent me to another camp where I spent a night in a single. But it wasn't a good situation since I was separated from the group. I think John should have admitted his error (instead he argued with me about it) and arranged for a single at the correct camp. He didn't. The next day our driver told me I'd have to stay in the other camp alone again- and I got very upset. Finally, they let me stay at the correct camp but I had to share at tent. I was so tired of arguing I agreed to it. This all left me very disappointed, though. What bad customer service!

Our driver was below average as well. On my other safaris the drivers engaged with us, told us lots of facts about the animals, and were very friendly. This driver only spoke to us when we asked him direct questions. He seemed bored. We got minimal information out of him about anything. While driving he never gave us an itinerary, didn't say when we'd stop to use the toilets, eat, etc. We would just stop and then he'd tell us what was going on. Some advanced notice would have been good. He also talked on his phone constantly while driving and this felt very unsafe, especially on the roads in Kenya. He was good, however, at bringing us to see the animals. He gets 4 stars for that. But his attitude was definitely below average.

The food at the Lenchada camp was good and the place as a good deal for the price. I would stay there again. The highlight of the trip were the other members of my safari. 

Single travelers- make sure you are clear about what you are paying for. "

Joan,NL,Visited: July 2019,20-Jul-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Watu Safaris (T) Ltd,1,Unprofessional,"Dissapointed
Unprofessionalism and disappointment guaranteed. 
My family and I experienced a nightmare with Watu Safaris managed by this man called Mr. Majenda. What was supposed to be a relaxing and memorable getaway with my two year old son and husband turned into a horrible cascade of unpredictable and disappointing events.
Before the trip:
Mr. Majenda and I were in good communication and he seemed quite courteous and civil. We arranged the trip for July 19th and 20th. We were to be picked up from Dar-es-salaam at 5:30 am and be driven to Mikumi to spend the day, sleep in the premises and continue our safari the next morning. Two days before the safari, I emailed Mr. Majenda to make sure if all plans were in order and he assured me like the professional I thought he was that all is well. He told me that my driver would contact me to make arrangements. I didn't hear from the driver so I contacted him the night before the trip. The driver had no idea about the trip. He told that he thought it was for the 29th and not the 19th. Mind you, Mr. Majenda had prepared my invoice with the correct dates and all emails had the dates of the safari as subject. So the driver then asked me to wait so he can clarify with his boss Mr. Majenda. They somehow managed to hire another driver from a different company right around midnight. I was notified by text about this new driver situation. 
Day of the trip:
We woke up early to prepare and were ready by 5am. Time of pick up arrives and no show. So I call the new driver. He picks up the phone, surprise! I had just woken him up. He told me he was not briefed about the pick up time and that he was on his way. I honestly think this guy was innocent in all this.
So we get around 6:15am and head out. We arrive at Morogoro and meet Mr. Majenda at Watu Safaris offices to complete our payment. He says sorry without any explanation and proceeds to deduct the payment. We head to Mikumi. At this point, I am already very dissatisfied and honestly feeling let down. What else could go wrong? 
At Mikumi park:
We arrive at the gate, present our IDs and ask for our booking for lodging that night. Guess what? None of that exists! After almost an hour of calls, no success as to where we were going to spend the night. Our entrance fees were supposed to be covered in our safari package but we ended up paying out of pocket to get into the park. At this point, I was expecting at least a call from Mr. Majenda but nothing. Two hours later, I decide to call him. I was very furious. He gave me a half type of apology and blamed it on his driver for mixing up the dates. I told him to own up for God's sake! He said that they had booked us at a hotel nearby to spend the night and that ""it was more expensive than the lodges"" that we were originally supposed to stay in. I was so disgusted. If I wasn't pregnant and also with a 2 year old, we would have driven back home the same day. We ended up staying at that hotel and completed the trip next morning. 
We did not get a personal apology from Mr. Majenda, nor did he call us to make sure we were okay. He didn't care about us after getting his money. The only thing he did was pay for the hotel bill including all meals and offered to reimburse us our entrance fee. I understand that some things can go wrong when planning a trip but in our case, all things went wrong and for this reason and the way he handled things, I do not consider Mr. Majenda a professional."

Them assured me that the safari had lions and we didn't see them, and besides the guides said that lions were rarely seen.

After the introduction the driver (no connection with Gatatu) told us something is wrong. No booking was made by Gatutu with the Uganda wildlife authority and also no permits left. Meaning we couldn¢®?t do the Gorilla trek, the main reason we booked a flight to Uganda! On our return to the lodge we met with someone from Gatatu (interim manager) and he apologised and we asked for a full refund which we received. We understood from him and someone from our lodge that Richard, owner of Gatatu, is in jail for fraud! We are very disappointed with Gatatu. From everything during our trip this was the only thing that had to go right because the permits are very limited. Gatatu, NEVER AGAIN."

The first one was to the Lake Nakuru National Park wich was a good experience due to the very nice guide John. The other one was to the Masai Mara. For that one Peter the Boss of Pega Tours gave me wrong information on the accommodation (stayed in a different camp than he said) and lied to me about the ""Great Migration"". I asked several times if it had really started early this year and he insisted it had. Before going to the Mara I heard from other sources that this was not the case. After arriving there the driver and guide confirmed that the Migration would probably start a month later. Very dishonest.
The home stay Pega offers in Nakuru is basic but offers tasty food and there are usually other interesting guests around.
The Safari Vehicle is fit for the good roads inside the Lake Nakuru Park but very unsafe for long distance travel."

Game drives are too short in duration (overall 5 hours) while 11+ hours are needed to go to Masai Mara and back. Period is supposed to be ideal to see the great migration, but we didn't get the chance to see it, as ""there was not enough time to go to the river"", which is practically a matter of tour guide decision! Staying at the outskirts of the reserve, close to the gate, automatically meant less chances of seeing all the animals. In fact we got to see just 3 out of the big 5 (lion, buffalo, elephant), and not even other animals that are supposed to be present in large numbers (cheetahs, crocodiles, hyenas etc), which doesn't make any real difference compared to going to Nairobi National Park which is right next to the capital. No comment on the accomodation or food, as these are definetely secondary issues for all visitors. If i knew before, I wouldn't do it."
John,US,Visited: July 2019,31-Jul-19,50-65,over 5 safaris,Viva Safaris,2,"The Wisconsin Dells of Safari operators - a bit of what was promised, but not much.  Disappointed.","My wife and I  completed the 5 day Kruger safari.  We are seasoned safari tourists and have been blessed to go on safari in Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania.  We have never been left dissatisfied until now.  The accommodations were fine and the food was as well.  But that¢®?s not why most of us go on safari ? it is the game drives after all.  
Every game drive was shorter than advertised.  Day one night drive was two hours instead of three.  Day two four-hour Bush walk was just one hour of bush walking.  When we got in the vehicle, we were told it was really just three hours including drive time there and back but overall it was about 2.5 hours.  Worse, the 3 hour afternoon game drive started an hour late and was only two hours.  Also, how many tourists who spend thousands to come all the way to South Africa really want to receive a pitch to allow elephant culling when they are viewing elephants?  We've gone from 600,000 elephants to 450,0000 in seven years according to the 2015 Great Elephant census across the continent. We are in the midst of elephant genocide. We see our first elephant and the arrogant young guide starts talking about culling them and feeding the meat to local villages. Not exactly what we expected to hear.  Day three - all day at Kruger National Park - no complaints.  But geez, we thought this was a 5 day Kruger trip.  Only one day was spent there ? the rest in reserves, some of which allow hunting.  Day 4 - a major disappointment.  The Moholoholo Wildlife Rehabilitation Centre did not espouse conservation.  In addition to culling and legal ivory sales, we were told that rhino horn should be legalized to discourage the black market.  Really?  Rhino horn?  I still can't believe we heard that.  Back to Mark's Camp by noon.  Yummy lunch. But no afternoon game drive. Our itinerary showeda 3 PM drive.  Nope due to reserve restrictions, it was a 5 pm drive.  Actually 530 as driver had to wait for more customers coming in from Johannesberg.   Big difference in night drives versus day drives ? photos aren¢®?t good at night, and many animals are stressed especially since it is a hunting reserve.  This last drive was also just two hours.  Driver didn¢®?t speak to us, and drove incredibly irresponsibly into a thicket of acacia thorn trees in the dark. I was actually injured and had to get antibiotics for a needless eye injury.  Last day we spent $400 to spend the entire afternoon at Mark¢®?s Camp.  Pathetic.  We did our own bush walk that was longer than the ones Viva did.  And we didn¢®?t need guns.    
My advice is focus on quality game drives.  No bait and switch on what you advertise.  There are far better safari companies in Africa.  I highly recommend Kenya¢®?s Gametrackers for a genuine safari experience or any Exodus trip.  Very disappointed.  Emailed owner of Viva safaris and no resolution.  Don¢®?t get suckered."

I hope they take this feedback and try improve their communication and their services. 

My family (my wife and my 2 daughters) experience, in terms of activities were good. 
We owe that to our guide. He is an excellent guide and very safe driver. 
There was one other person. I didn't know what the other guy did till the last day. 
There were discrepancies in the itineraries. What we were promised was different what was delivered.
We never did the early morning and the evening game drive.

Time gap between the departure time from Masindi Courtview hotel and the actual Rhino walk was more then 6 hours. Nothing to do for 6 hours. We just sat around did nothing.

From the very first night, accommodations were substandard, despite much better accommodation availability nearby properties.  They communicated and promised to us that our accommodation in Ziwa Sanctuary would not be a budget accommodation.
We spent the entire night awake with mouse and rats running around us. There were literally hundreds of live bugs and mouse droppings on the sheets.
We are still so upset about this which I am considering in taking further actions. 

Food options, well there were no food options at Parkside lodge. We ate whatever they made. One main course. That's it. 
To be fair, Courtview and Ziwa had food options.

We've paid a premium price expecting premium service. Our guide/driver was outstanding. Other than that it was terrible.
After I've learned what the charges were in the hotels and permits and entrance fees, the profit margin was significant. They basically put us in the cheapest and dirtiest places to make that profit.

Our bad experience with accommodations and food would not take away the joy and pleasure we had by learning about Ugandan people and culture. Kindest people we've ever met during our travels."

The vehicles advertised by Uhuru Travel were not provided and very inferior old vehicles were used despite our requests for replacements. We expected a vehicle similar to that in the pictures sent to us in an email but were transported in the sub-standard vehicles.

Apart from the age of the vehicle (manufactured in 1999, hence 20 years old), it had many unsafe features, namely:-
1. We were unable to open the one passenger door from inside the cabin - see pic 4 - jammed up against the seat and difficult to use
2. The seatbelts were difficult to attach and impossible to tighten
3. There was no left-hand rearview mirror - see pic 9
4. The seals were in a poor state
5. The bull-bar was dragging and had to be tied up - see pic 10
6. The seats were extremely uncomfortable - the backs were leaning uncomfortably too far whilst the seats all sloped making for a VERY uncomfortable ride
7. There was only one panic handle with considering the uneven and very bumpy roads further exacerbated the uncomfortable ride
8. The driver had to push up and down his window which was unsafe
9. Limited visibility through the windows

Finally, we paid extra for an upgrade of a vehicle which was not forthcoming.
We were given several promises to replace the vehicle with a better version followed by a number of excuses as to why we had to wait another day for one to be sent. No replacement vehicle was provided. Quote from a director ""You don't need a Ferrari for a Safari"".

We feel that this company has not been honest with us and has made what should have been a holiday to remember with pleasure and amazement to one of disappointment.  We also feel that they have let you (Safari Booking Company) down. We can hardly recommend you or them as reliable sources for safaris in the future.

Booked into a shoddy hotel last year during the Nairobi tour & charged at a more expensive rate than other similar agents in the area but because of my continued loyalty,  I overlooked that & put the ¢®¡Æway below par accommodation¢®¡¾ down to experience and instead, complained to the hotel directly. 

This year I was planning on booking my trips again with them starting with the Mombasa full dayer- again, more expensive than others but because I built a rapport from before I stuck with them.  Paid for lunch in advance but on the day after the meal I was informed that even after a starter and a mere main with a few soft drinks I still had to pay half the bill ! 

Full day trip turned into a half day as halfway through, the guide informed me that he had to leave and that the company was aware of this the night before, leaving me driving around aimlessly round town minus a guide till I was back at the hotel which I could have done in a taxi for a fraction of the price. 

The next day I thought it would be an easy resolve given my continuous loyalty to the company over the years and extra custom I had got them through other clients. A sheepish sorry was what I got- I thought I¢®?d give them a break and not suggest a refund for half a service but instead just what I paid to the meal be took off my next trip which was a ?1300 Maasai Mara trip- this was declined. I tried my best to make the agent Harrison realise that if I didn¢®?t get the equivalent of ?15 off that I would go elsewhere. 

Subsequently after days and days of back and fourth messaging reminding me of how he couldn¢®?t get it any less and that a sorry is all he could offer as that he would be doing it for free if he took that off with guarantees that I wouldn¢®?t get it cheaper elsewhere, I decided I had listened to enough of this salesman pitch & took my business elsewhere- best thing I could ever have done. Ofcourse after going elsewhere the discount could now surprisingly be applied although by this time I had made my mind up, 

The Mara Safari that he couldn¢®?t take off ?15 I now got ?195 off and also made a hefty saving on the Nairobi trip but on this occasion was booked into a really nice hotel and comfortable car and made to feel like my custom was valued at the end. 

I am fortunate that I return to kenya every year. I would hate to think that if I visited it just once, these customer service issues would be my lasting memory. Shop around if you want a better service, guaranteed customer service if issues come up and definitely more reasonable pricing. 

Everything is good till a problem arises - clearly there is no procedure on how to resolve issues. Refreshers on customer service are urgently needed as running on luck & hoping that no problems will come up is just not good enough in an industry where competition is round every corner. 

Being scared into thinking you are getting a good deal because they compare their prices to the ones in the hotel is just smoke & mirrors. Be smart"

Jonathan Pucci,FR,Visited: November 2022,07-Dec-22,20-35,first safari,Widman Tours & Safari,1,"Mistakes and delays, very bad experience","As an intro, I¢®?d like to mention this is a copy paste of my comment on trip advisor.

I am not surprised after coming back from our trip there, to see the previous comment ? Unprofessional experience ?, as it is exactly what we just lived too.

We chose the 2 days ? memorable safari ?, between Tarangire and Ngorongoro.

On our first day, 30min delays at our hotel, and guide not reachable, you start to wonder if you haven¢®?t just been scammed.
Then apparently out of nowhere, Widman was expecting us to have to full amount in cash to pay on the day for the parks entrance fees, even after our 10% deposit on his bank account, so we went withdrawing to our limit around 850$ in Tanzanian Shillings (TZS, their currency)
Then you¢®?re supposed to wait for the lunch boxes somewhere but the guy did not show up so you go somewhere else and again you wait. While waiting, the guide is paying for Tarangire entrance, in US dollars ! So actually they had the money.. anyway we are nice people and decide to focus on the trip ahead.

That being said, we enter the park at 11:50 ! After leaving at 8 our hotel in Arusha. Maps says 3h drive, so we were (departure supposed to be 7:30), more than a good hour late.

Rest of the day goes quite normal in the park, even though another group saw a family of lions that we did not.

We reach our lodge at 7pm, not the one advised on the website, price half cheaper according to booking but we paid everything now so.. diner is at 7:30, so not much to relax, but people and food were nice though so ok we¢®?ll see afterwards our overall satisfaction before complaining.

The next day, we are asked to be ready at 7 am, even though Ngorongoro is not far away from Karatu (our lodge city), to go pay for the Ngorongoro entrance, as it did not work the day before !

Then the mess begins : 

We skip the breakfast, but have to wait the bank opening at 8, so we take breakfast, I am asked to help and try paying online about 450$ to enter there and there refund me, but it does not work (see our good faith again), so we go to the bank, it finally opens at 8:30, we wait, our guide goes to pay, we wait about 40min in the car, getting harassed by locals wanting to sell their objects, we finally are able to go there but the guide is feeling ? dizzy ? so we get one of his friends to pass the local police check (small doubts about legal but well..), we get to the gate late but surprise, paiement is not accepted yet because of a network issue, so we wait until 10:45 to go through, and after a bit less than 1h drive get into the crater around 11:30 ! And we were ready at 7 ! (1h drive for maps)

It¢®?s not done, we enter the crater, and after 1h inside the car stops, technical issue, we cannot continue, it¢®?s 12:30.
I did not mention above that on the first day we already realised that no gauge in the car was working, so not speed indicator, no fuel indicator since the beginning, all cars were overtaking us whenever a 50km/h limit panel was there as our guide did not know his own speed and went slower.

From there we wait 1h expecting our guide to find a solution and thank god a car with french people inside was nice enough to take us back for almost finishing the tour (1 small hour as they were on the way back). So we get out of the crater, after spending total 2h inside, only 1 with Widmans car.
Then our guide had paid for a bus to take us back to our hotel on the second day before our going back, even there, the price doubled when the bus arrived and we¢®?ve been asked to help, to which we said no and the other company ? Simba ? actually paid for our return (they had to arrange themselves). It¢®?s the least they had to do.

Now for two days we¢®?ve been asking for a partial refund, explaining all this to Widman, and he only accepts to give 100$ back and begging for us not to post our experience, but that is clearly not enough for us.

So overall, delays, mistakes, very unprofessional people, and bad experience.

Not saying that the previous comments are false, but I imagine Widman is getting bigger with new guides and experiences, but he clearly does not know how run his business correctly. From other feedbacks on Tanzania, other companies were much more prepared and experiences were fantastic, so we strongly encourage anyone to look at other companies."

Activity 2 was a Dinner cruise on the Zimbabwe side which was really nice but Falcon never gave us a booking receipt and so the operators tried to charge us an extra fee which we shouldn't have been charged

Activity 3 was the Livingstone Isalnd/Devil's Pool lunch tour. Amazing experience which we almost missed out on becuase again Falcon never gave us a booking receipt.

Jose & Ana,ES,Visited: August 2023,20-Sep-23,35-50,first safari,Oscar Africa Safaris,1,Terrible experience,"We did the 3-day safari to Serengeti and Ngorongoro parks, and it was a terrible experience.

Out of the 3 days, we only got one and a half because they made many unnecessary stops on the way to the park (even though we told them we didn't want to stop). When we finally reached the park, the driver (who called himself Masai and was rude and arrogant) was driving quite fast, claiming that the next day would be when we'd see lots of animals (so we wasted that day).

On the second day, we did manage to see many animals after having a conversation with the other guide (a young guy who didn't seem to know much).

The worst part was the last day. We went to Ngorongoro (arriving around 10:30), and at 13:30, they told us it was time for lunch, which seemed fine because the park closes at 18:00. However, to our surprise, when we finished eating at 14:00, they said the safari was over. We spent nearly an hour negotiating to leave at around 17:00, but in the end, the driver did as he pleased and rushed out of the park at 15:45, not even stopping when we saw elephants just outside the park (other cars were stopping).

The car was small and uncomfortable (the windows were very low, and you could hardly see anything when the roof wasn't raised), and the driver's attitude was the worst we've experienced (and we've traveled quite a bit).

The company's manager offered us one night all-inclusive at a nice hotel in Zanzibar, but it wasn't what we expected (a proportional refund for the time we lost was more appropriate, as we suggested).

We wouldn't recommend this company, as a safari costs over a thousand dollars per person, and even if you tried, it's hard to do it as poorly as they did."

When we asked some question, he always replied in a derisive tone, and some time tap for chip.
I strongly recommend you to avoid him and this company in order to enjoy your trip."

Juanita,US,Visited: November 2022,03-Dec-22,35-50,first safari,Bienvenido Kenya Tours and Safaris,2,Poor service,"I booked an 8 day Kenya/Tanzania safari for my 2 children and I. Purity was amazing to work with prior to leaving my home country. She was very responsive and even went to the embassy on my behalf when I was having problems with my visa. However, once on the safari things started to go wrong. We were picked up from Nairobi and took the long drive to Masai Mara, we did an evening game drive that first day and was brought to our tent camp for the night. Camp was very basic, only had working electricity in the main cafeteria area, so had only a few hours to charge devices. The 2nd day was a full day game drive and visit to Masai village which was wonderful. Day 3 (which was my birthday) is where the itinerary changed. We were supposed to visit Lake Nakuru for a safari boat tour, but that was canceled, there were no other plans for the day besides to drive back to Nairobi and go to a hotel, the next day the plans were to drive from Nairobi to Tanzania and check into hotel upon arrival. That was 2 days back to back filled with just driving. That was not fair to my kids or myself as that was not in the itenerary and I did not pay for 2 days of driving. I emailed purity as I was unsure of what to do and she apologized for the inconvenience. I decided to cancel and book with a different company as I really did not want to spend the entire next day driving. I asked to be dropped off at the airport and took a flight to Tanzania and was picked up from another tour company and had an exceptional experience. Essentially I paid more for the 3 days I was with this company than the 5 days with the second one. The food provided was very subpar, for lunch having boxed sandwiches with cucumber and tomato. Our tour guide was nice however not very helpful with telling us about the things we were seeing. It was a very frustrating experience to say the least, but I am glad it ended on a more positive note with a different company. Please do your research prior to booking. Research the lodges, the amount of driving that will be done and if possible request a specific tour guide. I was hoping for a very positive learning experience for my kids and that was not the case. I also requested a hot air balloon ride over the Masai Mara and was told that would be available at an extra cost and was not available to us while there. "
Judy,AU,Visited: June 2018,01-Aug-18,50-65,over 5 safaris,Solaris Tours and Safaris,1,Update o n my previous review,"I wrote earlier about the very unpleasant safari experience we had with Solaris that finished at the end of June, and the fact that they owed us over US$2,000 at the end of the safari. This week (a month later)I received a refund of the actual money I had paid to get into the Tanzanian parks, all of which were supposedly included in the itinerary. I was surprised and glad to receive this refund. I believe the fact that I received the refund had everything to do with our negative reviews here on SafariBookings and on TripAdviser, and my complaint to the Kenyan Tourism Regulatory Authority. Solaris then requested I take down my negative reviews.

However, receiving this refund back does not alter the fact that our safari with Solaris was a horrible and extremely stressful experience, and one which I hope others can learn from. It does not change the fact that our accommodation was downgraded from that shown on the itinerary at least half the time, and it does not change the fact that the vehicle allocated to us in Kenya was not the 4wd promised by the itinerary, causing us to spend at least one day extra on roads instead of in parks, and the driver in Kenya shouldn't have had a licence, let alone be allowed to drive with passengers. I told Solaris all this when I responded to their email and refund."
Julia,US,Visited: July 2018,08-Jul-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Benson Safaris Tanzania,2,Company did ok but guide was disappointing,"I communicated via email with Benson on a 1-week itinerary for me and my 3 children and he presented a comprehensive mid-range safari package in a timely manner. Everything went well until we started out with our private guide. Logistics were smooth with one exception that was clarified with a quick call to Benson. Otherwise, the guide was obviously more interested in chatting with others on his 2 cell phones and car CB than in providing information to us, his clients. Some of the communication was between guides sharing animal sightings in the area and there was no shortage of those  the guide pursued but there was more than one case of me seeing an animal in a place that required backing up and the guide disregarded my request. This was my 3rd time on a guided safari but my childrens¢®? first and they missed out on so much, even with my advocacy. I prompted the guide several times to provide information - differences in species, etc. - and answers were one or two sentences at best. It got to the point at one meal where, after loudly reminding my daughter that using electronics during dinner was rude and unacceptable, I had to ask him to put his cell phone away minutes later. He never asked what kind of animals we were interested in, never pulled out a field guide, and offered very little personal insight. I felt like my family was a load to be transferred between locations rather than a family who had crossed half the globe to appreciate his homeland. We met other Benson guides who showed far more interest in their jobs (and us) so I think we got the guy who¢®?d grown tired/bored after 15 years of guiding. One other minor thingBenson claimed he would come by to meet us which he never did. The week was good in the sense that the animals are everywhere in the parks, camps and food were good and we didn¢®?t have any catastrophes but I know the trip would¢®?ve been MUCH better with a different guide.

Julian,DE,Visited: October 2017,28-Nov-17,20-35,first safari,I love Africa Safaris Ltd,1,Do not book at this cheater agency!!,"We confirm the comment of Dawn Clark. We travelled with this ""company"" two weeks ago and have been cheated too. Our plan was totally changed. We never slept in a lodge which was planned. The tour to the Serengeti was cancelled, because there was allegedly no car us. In Lake Manyara National Park we were the only onces who visited it with a Toyota van with dirty unopenable windows instead of an offroad vehicle with open roof (which was booked).

We paid 166$ more than we agreed and never got any money back. Although Victor (the agent) told us that we get this money back and also a refund because of the cancelled Serengeti tour there was nothing but excuses. Every day there was at least one anoying phone call from him with bad news for us like ""We have no car"", ""we cannot pay the driver"", ""you must stay here one night more (again)"". This was wasted holiday time and very unpleasant. Cars, drivers and guides changed almost daily.

This company seems to be no real safari company and we think that all the persons who allegedly work there are the same guy called Victor. This guy is something between incapable of planning and criminal. He is unfriendly and dishonest.

Tansania was beautiful but this company/guy destroyed our holiday. In the end my wife was afraid of his criminal aura. For sure all good comments for this company are fake. If we have not met such nice people who cared about us and have not paid more than we agreed we would have been probably lost in Tansania.

Do not book at this cheater agency!! "

This ruined the mood of the safari entirely. He also made us feel bad for expecting water free when it was in the itinerary. Lastly, English literacy and customer service in general was poor.

Julie and Mallory,US,Visited: January 2020,03-Feb-20,35-50,first safari,Bluerange Connect Limited,2,Falsified itinerary and absolutely unprofessional.  Highly not recommended.,"Their listed Itinerary is falsified.  This is the actual itinerary.  I made a recap on daily events with full details. Future tourists must be informed accordingly. 
Pre-Tour (13/1/2020) 
As per itinerary and payment deposit ($930) confirmation we will be picked up from either our hotel or airport on Day 1 of the safari to pay the remaining balance before starting the tour.  We made our own plans to be in the country 2 days before our safari tour to explore the city area.  We booked our own hotels and driver with plans for both days.  On Monday, 13/1/2020, 2 days before the tour, we received a sudden text message asking if we were in the country yet and stating the company (Bluerange Connect) wants to send a driver to pick us up immediately.  Bluerange stated that they need to bring us to their office and require us to pay the remainder of the balance $2202.55 + commission in CASH immediately in order to go ahead to our safari tour.  They insisted that if we don¢®?t pay in CASH, any credit card charges will take 2 days to post to their account and they don¢®?t have adequate funding to pay for our entire tour without us paying up front.  We informed our hotel manager and other honest local people of this sudden issue and everyone said not to fall for a scam, nothing gets done in CASH at last minute.  After an hour of stressful debate, Bluerange reluctantly agree to allow us to pay the remaining balance upon our pickup on Day 1 of our tour.  

Day 1 (15/1/2020) Nairobi to Samburu
We were picked up from our hotel at 7:30am to go to the office to pay the remaining balance and ¢®¡Æbriefing¢®¡¾.  We were escorted into a small office of a few rooms and two friendly ladies staff took multiple pictures with us and asked to post on Facebook and social media.  We then went into Willis Orowe¢®?s office (managing director we were dealing with the entire time).  He took a call from other non related business and casually chatted as we sat waiting to pay and be on our way.  There was no rush and no courtesy on his end to help us get out of the office any sooner.  After we made the payment, they gave us another copy of the same itinerary.  We asked if they can quickly point out on the map as to each day¢®?s destination point.  Willis had another female staff come in who looked at the map completely confused.  We said it¢®?s ok, we can map it out ourselves.  She proceeded to reading us the entire itinerary, literally word for word.  Finally, we proceeded down to the safari van to leave, not before a few more ladies staff took more pictures of us in front of the van to be posted to social media.  After over an hour at this office, we began our drive to Samburu around 10am with our tour guide Ken.  We had found Ken through a recommendation on tripadvisor which we need to update them on the actual experience.  The direct drive took almost 6 hours.  We passed a view of Mt Kenya and asked how tall it is.  Ken did not know and said he¢®?ll get back to us (he never did).  We were brought to KFC at 12:30pm for lunch which was very shocking as we expected local foods.  We didn¢®?t expect anything luxurious but at least good local food which would have been cheaper.  After 30 minutes of lunch stop, we continued the drive and arrived at Samburu past 4pm.  The game drive was basically driving from the entrance gate to the lodge check-in which was done slowly.  We were excited to be in the beautiful park finally and saw an elephant, antelopes and giraffes.  We arrived at the lodge at 5:45pm.  Unpacked and waited for dinner at 7pm.

Day 2 (16/1/2020) Samburu 
We started our morning game drive at 7am.  Back at camp by 9am for breakfast.  After breakfast, we walked around the little lodge to take a few pictures but we had nothing to do at all and were not allowed outside the gate.  The tiny swimming pool was green colored and I would not advise going in.  We sat around until lunch time at 1pm.  After lunch, we tried to take a nap to kill time as we were still bored senseless.  Finally 4pm we went on our afternoon game drive and returned at 7pm for dinner.  Ken offered to take us to meet the Samburu people, that it would be nice to see the locals and insist that it was only 2000 shillings per person.  We explained that this additional cost was never mentioned to us.  We specifically asked Bluerange (Willis) about optional additional cost and received email confirmation with prices (Masai Village $10 pp, Lake Naivasha boat ride $20 pp, Hell¢®?s Gate bicycle $5 pp).  Ken insisted that everything is incorrect.  He gave us specific additional costs of Samburu village $20 pp, Masai Village $20 pp, Thompson Falls $5 pp, Lake Naivasha boat ride $30 pp and Hell¢®?s Gate bicycle $10 pp.  He was unprofessional and firmly insisting that this is just a little extra cost and even questioned if we actually thought things were all inclusive.  I explained that I had confirmed with Willis on what is inclusive and certainly doesn¢®?t match what he arbitrarily gave us.  We decided to skip both Samburu and Masai Village all together which Ken was certainly not happy about.  

Day 3 (17/1/2020) Samburu to Lake Nakuru (6 hours drive with nothing for the day)
After breakfast, around 8am we had our game drive on the way to the gate.  We were told that getting to Lake Nakuru will take 6 hours and there will be no game drive that day.  Ken advised us that Lake Nakuru is very small and we will get there by evening so there is nothing to see until the next day.  The drive was mostly in silence aside from the fact that Ken is on his personal cell phone multiple times per hour.  We arrived at the equator around 1pm.  The local gentleman did a water demonstration, afterwards offering us a paper certificate for $5 each and or tipping him.  After, we had our boxed lunch from the hotel at the bench.  It consisted of a very dry piece of chicken leg that caused painfully swollen gums and teeth.  Also, a tiny square sandwich of two pieces of bread with mayo and a slice of cucumber, an apple, bag of chips and tiny juice box.  After 30 minutes, we continued our trip.  We stopped at Thompson Falls for pictures for 200 shillings ($2) per person.  (Ken questioned if we wanted to skip Thompson Falls too, implying that we were being cheap since we skipped his arbitrary cost for Samburu village)  Locals insisted on dragging us to their souvenir stands to buy things.  After 30 minutes, we were on our way.  Ken said he needed to find a bank to make a money transfer in order to access the national park tomorrow.  We finally found the bank.  We arrived at Wagon Wheel hotel around 5pm to check in.  Ken said he¢®?ll meet us at 7am to start the drive and left us for the night.  We had dinner at 7:30pm at the local restaurant downstairs the hotel, local food was delicious. 

Day 4 (18/1/2020) Lake Nakuru to Masai Mara
After breakfast at Wagon Wheel Hotel, we finally got to see Lake Nakaru.  Our game drive was from 7am to 11am.  We saw a rhino, buffalos, zebras among other antelopes.  Then it was more than a 5 hours straight drive to Masai Mara.  (Plenty of time for Ken to be on his personal cell phone and us to stare blankly out the window bored) We stopped for 30 minutes to eat our packed lunch from Wagon Wheel Hotel.  It was good local food (chicken, pork or beef with rice) however, the portion was just about 10 tablespoons.  After lunch, we continued our drive and reached Masai Mara Manyatta Camp close to 6pm.  After checking in, we had dinner in the tented camp at 7pm.  

Day 5 (19/1/2020) Masai Mara
After breakfast at the tented camp (sausage, beans, eggs, toast), we left to begin our full day Masai Mara game drive at 8am.  We were the last ones to leave for the game drive.  As stated on the itinerary, during the early hours, it¢®?s best to view game.  However, we certainly did not start at 6:30am as others did.  We did see four of the big five today including a family of 10 lions which was exciting.  This was the one part of the trip where Ken was actually not preoccupied on his personal cell phone and did an amazing job driving to the lions for a close-up view.  We did thank him dearly for this.  We were taken to the Kenya-Tanzania border stone.  Ken stopped the van, pointed and told us to go take pictures.  We saw other safari vans where the tour guides walked their tourists around the stone, explaining the history and facts while taking individual pictures for them.  Certainly not the kind of guide we got.  We asked Ken if he can help us take a picture which he did.  He then drove us to an area by the river which we had to wait for an armed guard to escort us around to see hippos and alligators across the river.  The walk took about 30 minutes.  Ken left us by the river and said a guard will come take us.  Other tourists had their guide with them and their guide tracked down a guard to ask to take their tourist group for the walk.  Since nobody spoke for us and we were left standing there, we just quietly went along with the other tourists.  When we got back however, Ken made sure to remind us to tip the guard.  (This was yet another event and expense that was not mentioned prior) We then had a picnic lunch under a tree.  The camp had packed us a lunch bag of a tough dry meatless chicken leg, tiny sandwich or mayo and cucumber, banana and boxed juice.  After lunch, we continued our game drive, searching for a leopard and seeing more giraffes and amazing animals.  Our game drive ended at 5:30pm.  We had dinner back at the tented camp at 7:30pm.  

Day 6 (20/1/2020) Masai Mara to Lake Naivasha
After breakfast at the tented camp (sausage, beans, eggs, toast), we left around 7am and had a game drive going towards the gate to leave Masai Mara.  On the way to the gate, we managed to see a leopard, the big five is complete thanks to Ken.  If we think of questions to ask him about animals, he answers them well.  Other than that, it was clear he had no interests in any conversation with us.  It was a long straight drive of over 5 hours to Lake Naivasha.  We arrived at around 1pm to eat our lunch that was packed from the camp.  It was yet another painfully dry chicken leg, tiny sandwich of a slice of cucumber, a banana, a hard boiled egg and a box juice.  After lunch, we went for the boat ride on Lake Naivasha.  Ken now tells us that the boat ride is 1 hour for $20 pp and then there is a guide to take us on a private island to walk around for another hour for $30 pp.  He said it will Only be $100 for us both.  We decided to go for just the 1 hour boat ride as we had planned before the trip.  We were taken to an office with a lady telling us it will be $20 pp.  There were no signs or written notice of costs or even such thing as a boat ride.  It was all word of mouth.  After the boat ride, it was 3pm.  I asked Ken if there is anywhere at all that he would like to show us or take us to since he said we were not allowed to walk around by ourselves.  He angrily said he wanted us to do the full boat ride and guided walk and since we refused to spend $100, there is nothing to do for us and he is taking us straight to the hotel.  He dropped us off at the hotel before 4pm and said he will pick us up at 7am the next day for Hell¢®?s Gate.  That was the end of that day, we were left stranded at the hotel with no plans and no considerations.  

Day 7 (21/1/2020) Hell¢®?s Gate National Reserve ? 4 hours with rest of the day stranded
After breakfast, we left Taphe hotel at 7am to head to Hell¢®?s Gate National Reserve which was about 30 minutes drive away.  When we got there, Ken said the bicycle rentals will be $15 pp.  We were outraged in the constant change of prices according to how much he feels like ripping off the tourist.  We said he mentioned it will be $10 pp (which is already double the amount that Willis gave).  Ken sounded like he was caught giving random numbers and quietly said Oh I told you $10 pp, let me talk to them.  (Acting as though he was negotiating with the locals for a price for us).  We rented bicycles for $10 pp and hired a guide for $20 to bike with us through the park.  The safari van was certainly nowhere near us unlike the itinerary kindly stating that the van will be behind us in case we¢®?re tired.  Ken parked the van and went to rest at a restaurant while we biked about 8 kilometers.  It was a very direct bike to the gorge which was closed.  (there was an accident where tourists were killed during a flash flood and the gorge closed in September 2019 as a result.  We had been planning this trip with Bluerange for over two months and Willis did not mention any such closure) We took a few pictures and was on the way back.  We were back by the van at 11am.  Ken said since the gorge is closed, Hell¢®?s Gate is a very small park and he is not sure why our itinerary claimed we will have a full day there and that there is nothing to do.  He drove us back to the hotel by 11:30am and we were again left stranded with nothing to do for the rest of the day.  After lunch, we decided to walk outside and not be bored to death.  We were told by the hotel staff that we can walk towards town but advised to not go too far for security reasons.  We only walked about 30 minutes and turned back before we were too deep in town.  We took a nap before dinner as there was absolutely nothing to do.  

Day 8 (22/1/2020) Lake Naivasha to Amboseli (6 hours drive)
After breakfast, we left to start our drive to Amboseli.  It was another long 6 hours drive in silence since our tour guide was constantly on his personal cell phone or else just not saying a word.  We got to Amboseli around 1pm and ate our packed lunch in the car as we drove towards a view point.  Unfortunately, it was very cloudy and we couldn¢®?t see the top of Kilimanjaro.  Ken drove around to let us take pictures but there were not too many animals out.  He was again on his personal cell phone and asked how long we want to stay.  He drove us to see the flamingos which we stayed about 20 minutes for pictures.  He drove us to our tented camp (AA lodge) by 5:30pm.  We had dinner at the tented camp at 7:30pm.  This was actually the best dinner we had the whole trip.  It was a buffet style dinner but various kinds of delicious local dishes.  Even the fresh baked bread with butter was good.  

Day 9 (23/1/2020) (Amboseli to Nairobi)
After a delicious breakfast, we left the lodge at 6:45am.  We had a game drive on the way to exit Amboseli National Park.  Our game drive ended exactly 9am sharp as Ken had mentioned.  We drove about 3 hours back to Nairobi and had some traffic when we were in the city.  Ken dropped us off at our hotel that we booked in advance.  The suggested tips for tour guides are $10 pp / day given that the tour guide does an average acceptable job.  Ken does a great job at finding you the big five but nothing more.  As a tour guide he is absolutely unexperienced and unprofessional.  We were appalled at how he randomly gave us prices and very obviously showed us he was not happy with us declining some suggested tourist traps and left us at hotels stranded with nothing to do.  I was unhappily agreeing to giving him the average tips of $20 per day for both of us.  My boyfriend however, felt inclined to give him $25 per day even though he was just as unhappy and complaining about Ken ripping us off on additional items.  Ken was lucky on this tip.  I would not recommend him for any future tours for anyone.  If you want to see the big five and be treated like an ignorant tourist getting ripped off, driving 6 hours daily in silence then you can go to him for sure.

Even guides or drivers that I talked about this, seamed to know the non professionalism of this company.
I booked a 2 days safari to Amboseli a month ago, a quote was processed and approved. 
I emailed Erick 3 days before the departure to have all the details about pick up time and place, he emailed me back only the day before the safari to tell me that the safari was cancelled (telling me it wasn¢®?t any departure for amboseli on this date, even though of a confirmation and telling before that the group I meant to go with cancelled their safari) not even any apologies. 
I had to call him for him to explain me the outcome, once again not even any apologies (if you see all his complaints answers online you can get the tone he takes with his customers), we argued 10min about what solution he could give me. He end up offering the 3 days trip for $50 more instead of $100 even though I only wanted 2 days  to enjoy the rest of Nairobi.
- the driver came to pick me up at my hotel. Half way though to the safari company office, the driver gave me his phone to talk to Erick the manager of Sun splash safaris. Erick told me that he could not giving the 3 days safari for this price anymore and it will have to be $100 extra. I could not say no as I couldn¢®?t organise another safari on this short notice, I was not really happy and really frustrated by the situation.
The safari itself was really good but it was not sun splash safaris who organised the safari but another one. Amboseli is a really nice destination with  amazing views of the Kilimanjaro."
Justin,US,Visited: June 2019,01-Jul-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Alliance Destinations - Kenya,2,Great Safari but Problematic Management,"The safari, in and of itself, was great. Our accommodations were good, our driver/guide George was fantastic, and the parks were unbelievable. The only negative about the safari itself was there was too much driving -- no matter what company you use you should confirm driving times before signing up.

My gripe is with how our safari was managed:

1 -- The order of parks that we visited was switched last minute and without my approval. I found this out after I sat down in the jeep on the first day. This is totally unacceptable. James and I even discussed this option months before and decided against it. This is bordering on breach of contract.

2 -- James's communication left something to be desired. At first, James was super prompt, always responding within a day. As we closed in on the trip, he took multiple days to reply to different questions, and when I asked the name of our driver he didn't bother replying. This all left me sketched out and worried that we were being scammed.

There's too many safari operators out there to bother with a company like this one..."

The owner also reversed the order of our safari and mountain trek without notifying us until we arrived. As of this writing, Bramwel Safaris owes me more than $5,000 USD which they are unable to pay.

If you send this company money, you risk arriving in Tanzania with nothing -- no hotels or lodges, no guides, no park fees paid. There is a word for this - it is called theft."

Seems like a scam under a new name Xplore2Africa,"I traveled with Xplore2Africa (previously Sunsets in Africa) in August 2023. The tour was a terrible experience. No accomodation corresponded to the itinerary I paid for. I was constantly downgraded to the hotels of far lower quality and far lower price. My driver was not booked for the first day. The same applies to safaris. They were booked in the last minute resulting in stress and total chaos when we arrived in Etosha. MY NAMIBIAN GUIDE, subcontacted by Xplore2Africa, HAS TILL NOW NOT BEEN PAID for his work. Whenever I complained about something, the reaction of the agency was very agressive, or there was no reaction, or they gave like totally absurd excuses to justify the lower price of the accomodation (e.g. the lawn, called by them 'a garden', at the B&B at the outskirts of Swakopmund was supposed to offer me better comfort than a prestigious hotel in the city centre. After I complained to the TourRadar through which I found the tour, I got a small compensation,  but the feeling of being scammed and cheated cannot be justified in any way. Moreover, the breach of labour law (no payment to my guide) should be legally sanctionned, and I am planning further legal action on that matter.

Among others those agencies include tourist line safaris, absolute holiday safaris and big time safaris!
We be booked a 13 day safari tour through Kenya and Tanzania for 4000usd p.p and paid 30% deposit. After paying the deposit, communication abruptly stopped. We didn't think much of it yet but were already concerned. At no point they provided further instructions and/or asked for hotel name to pick us up etc. We contacted them instead twice to confirm the hotel name for pick up and they confirmed pick up time. When we arrived in Nairobi I again confirmed hotel name for pick up. Among day of pick up after 1h there were still nobody, I contacted them and they said someone just left the office. Half hour later, still nothing. Then apparently it turned out the driver went to a different hotel. Long story short we ended up already 3h late that morning. After paying the rest of the amount the problems started.
They started changing the plans and tried to cut off game drives. 
The safari car was in a very bad condition. It was falling apart and my partner even hit her head the first day on one of the many loose nails/screws. She bleeded and got a big bump on the head. The car was filthy, almost all windows broken, no handles, no A/C and so on.
On the second day every 10-15min the driver started checking under the car. He told us apparently the brake oil was leaking. 
On the third day in the middle of the road the breaks stopped working, and the driver was then driving only 10-20km/h because he couldn't use the breaks and was looking for a mechanic. We lost overall 3h that day. The next day without any communication or warning he drove into a mechanic shop again and put the car with us inside into the forklift so that the mechanics can check something. We didn't know what's going on. He didn't even ask us to leave the car in the meantime. We were literally left inside the car not knowing how long it might take or so. I was looking at all the other tour cars the vast majority were really good. Only a handful of cars were equally bad
Because of the car we lost multiple hours of game drive.
Also the driver/guide was constantly late in the morning and we were the last to leave the hotel and usually the first to come back. He literally the whole time on the phone, didn't communicate anything with us and even worse, was picking up people and doing some extra stuff despite having a private tour. 
Until now we thought it's just bad service.
However, when we were about to go to Tanzania only then we were told that the Tanzania part will be with a different tour company. Something we were not aware of at any stage prior to paying full amount. Once we crossed the border the actual real and big problems started.
It turned out tourist line safari is not a tour company per se but hires different companies to do the safari.
The tour company that picked us up in Tanzania had a completely different plan and way worse hotels. E.g. instead of staying in nysa lodge, rhino lode or sangaiwe lodge which cost around 200-400usd a night, we stayed in octagon lodge and charity hotel in Arusha which costs only 30usd a night.
We immediately started calling TouristLine safaris and told them this is not what we booked and paid for. But they just said that they booked different accommodation as per availability. However this was never communicated with us before. They didn't inform us about all the changes and thus we completely overpaid. I asked for either doing the tour we actually paid for or get a refund for the Tanzania part because this was completely different and low budget. They first said that they will refund but then immediately said that its not possible etc.
The agency in Tanzania was also lying to us and was constantly contradicting themselves. First they said they told tourist line that they can't book the accomodations we paid for and blammed TouristLine. TouristLine safaris at this point stopped responding to us and just said this is now the tour and not their responsibility anymore, we can either do this safari with the  changed program and accommodations or come back and loose all the money. 
We were left with no choice but doing a low budget safari. We lost overall at least 2 days worth of game drives and stayed in accommodations worth much less.
We started doing some research and found out that numerous tourists were scammed this way. They suddenly change the plan and put tourists in cheaper accommodations blaming one and each other and nobody actually feels responsible. They sell tours and accommodations that they never actually booked or even had.
We also found out that they operate under several different tour agency names.
Unfortunately we feel scammed and our dream holiday became a nightmare. We were left with a tour that was not what we booked and the frustration and disappointment is huge.
We also overpaid by a big margin.
When we arrived back in Nairobi we went to the office and there were different people actually saying that TouristLine Safaris doesn't operate here but after they realized we won't get scammed so easily they started arguing and after 2 hours they agreed to refund us very little amount not even covering the difference of one accomodation. There were so many men in the office and we felt threatened and in danger. We were then forced to sign some paper that we agree not to sue them. It seems this is the way the silence people and keep scamming tourists.
Please guys be aware and don't book from this agency and any other one under the names of Lilian, Fiona or daniel. We are not even sure if those names are real or who we were actually talking with on the phone and in the office. "
Kamau,KE,Visited: June 2019,03-Jul-19,20-35,first safari,Jocky Tours and Safaris,1,"Nice gamedrives, excellent driver, bad accommodations, miserable customer service from the office","We¢®?ve been doing a tour for 16 days/15 nights with this company. We visited several nationalparks and destinations in Kenya.

Nairobi-Amboseli-Mount Kenya-Thompson falls-Lake Nakuru-Kakamega forest-Kisumu-Masai Mara-Naivasha-Nairobi was our tour

First of all we can say thanks to our driver and guide Evans, who was very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed all the game drives with him, we were able to spot all of the big five and he was able to tell us a lot about all the animals we saw. He¢®?s very experienced and has a lot of knowledge.

So on the first day in Nairobi we¢®?ve been picked up on time at our hotel and drove to the office to do the outstanding payment with our  creditcard. The office wanted to charge us 5% on that amount, which we refused because it was not a small amount and we already paid a lot, it was never mentioned or written anywhere that paying with creditcard will be charged with 5%. If we would have known we would have paid full in advance. We started our program in Nairobi, it was fine and in the evening we arrived at the sopa lodge in Amboseli. The hotel was good and the first game drive the next day was great. On our way back to the lodge our drive told us our program the next to days will change.

There the disaster began, they wanted to fool us the first time. Our schedule was to visit the Mau Mau caves on the way from Amboseli to Mount Kenya the next day but it was not possible due to lack of time (whole day driving). So he told us we would postpone it to the day after and skip a whole day gamedrive/visit in Ol Pejeta Conservancy (Sweetwater Rhino Sanctuary). That¢®?s ridiculous, they obviously really tried to fool us and why was the visit to Mau Mau caves planned anyway, if they now it¢®?s not enough time for it? So of course we¢®?ve been insisting on our gamedrive in Ol Pejeta.

So after the second night in Amboseli we spend the whole day on the road to Nanyuki (Mount Kenya) and arrived at Sportsman Arms Hotel in the evening. Horrible hotel, unfriendly and inconsiderate staff, dark rooms with a lot of broken items (lights, dustbin) and water dripping out of the bathroom light from above. Restaurant also very dark and uncomfortable, staff as mentioned, buffet very small and not tasty at all.

The next day our gamedrive at Ol Pejeta was great but we had to quit in the early afternoon due to one out of four persons was already feeling bad because of conditions of the last night... sad because of the nice conservancy and bad because of returning early to that hotel (we just thought ok we¢®?ll tolerate one more night there).

The next day we went to Nyahururu to visit the Thompson falls, spent few hours on the road and arrived at the lodge for lunch. Already two out of four persons felt bad/were ill due to the last two nights. Lodge was very old and rustical but had charme but could definitely be maintained better, especially the showers.

The next morning we took off to check-in to our hotel in Nakuru and left with picnic lunches for Lake Bogoria which was a nice trip. We arrived at our hotel (Hillside Court) in the late afternoon and took a first look into our rooms and we¢®?ve been disappointed again. Dirty sheets, leaking toilets, dirty towels and so on.
That was the point we decided not to be disappointed about accommodations anymore and just to look forward to get back to the hotels late and wake up early the next morning for gamedrives/excursions.
The next day we had our gamedrive at Lake Nakuru, which was as enjoyable as the other gamedrives! In the evening we had to go back to our hotel, at least the staff tried everything to get us comfortable. 

The next day we went to Kakamega forest and finally had a good accommodation again, the Rondo Retreat. Really charming, quiet and in the middle of the forest! After a good night we had a guided walk into the forest the next morning and went to Kisumu arriving at our hotel for lunch.

In Kisumu we decided to upgrade the hotel in advance on our own cost to have two comfortable nights with a day at leisure in between! Later it paid off...

After two nights in Kisumu we took off to Masai Mara with a stop at the soapstone factory in Kisii which was quite interesting. We arrived at our camp in the Mara at dinner-time. The Lechada camp is not maintained well, the mattresses are done, the showers are very dark, dirty, no hot showers, all in all very poor bathrooms, food was okay but the dining hall also very dark. Staff and the Masai have been friendly.
The gamedrives the next two days have been amazing, the Masai Mara is really awesome.

After three nights in the camp we took off to Naivasha and we¢®?ve been really excited about our hotel, the Lake Naivasha Resort was on the program for two nights. Arriving at Lake Naivasha our driver told us we¢®?ll stay in the ?sweet lake resort¢®? which is a totally different price category than the Lake Naivasha Resort wish we found out really fast online, so we told the driver and insisted on to stay in the Lake Naivasha Resort as per program. As we were doing our boatride before lunch, our driver was to sort out with the office. As we came back I had to talk with the boss Lucy from the office for the first time, the lady really told me that the hotel was changed and we¢®?ve been informed about, which was not true and a lie! After me still insisting on us staying in the better hotel as per program she was shouting at me on the phone!!! It was getting later and later so that we even had no lunch and we finally accepted to stay in another hotel called Masada resort, because Lucy was not reasonable and insisting to her lie the hotel was changed and we knew. So we checked in at around 6pm in the Masada Resort without having any lunch (all meals included) and the hotel was also definitely not the same category as the hotel on the program, the hotel that we have paid for! How can a hotel/program that we have paid for be changed? 

The next day we went to Hells Gate Nationalpark and had a gamedrive in the morning  to back at the hotel for lunch and afternoon at leisure. After another night at that hotel we took off to Nairobi the next day.

We would never recommend that agency to anybody, please be careful!
Our driver/guide Evans Ngigi was really excellent but the Office/the boss Lucy really unprofessional, customer service was very bad or no customer service at all! She tried to fool us with skipping Ol Pejeta Conservancy which is 95 USD per person, in total almost 400 USD. And finally she corned us with our hotel in Naivasha and saved a lot of money (hundreds). This lady is criminal! Sadly we had no chance to react because it was already paid and booked directly with that agency in Kenya."
Kandice,UK,Visited: February 2019,22-Mar-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Axis Africa Expedition & Safaris,2,"It was ok, but overpriced and kind of sketchy","The van was comfortable enough but very old and without AC, so be prepared for that. Our driver was nice, the places we stopped for food were not clean. (Bring toiler paper and hand sanitizer with you) All the restaurants are buffet style and left in serving wear that was sitting out for much longer then I feel is safe. 
We were meant to go into the Masai Mara for 2 days, but the driver talked us into only going for one ""extra long"" day, which was only an hour longer then the day was originally meant to be. He also told us we could go into the Serengeti and instead took us to the border and told us that was it. In the end we paid for two days when we only had about 12 hours, allowing them to pocket the extra cash that would have been spent on the next days entry fee. 
The place we camped was ok, not like it was pictured but it was acceptable and the people who worked there were nice. There was an overwhelming pressure from Axis to pay up front and in cash. One day included a picnic lunch, which was precooked chicken that wasn't kept in a cooler, but in cardboard box and ended up giving me food poisoning. I would recommend brining your own snacks. 
After the trip we were informed that they are being looked into for questionable practices. 
I wouldn't book with them again, especially since there are rumors surrounding the legitimacy of their practices."
Karen,UK,Visited: July 2018,02-Aug-18,20-35,first safari,Sense of Africa,2,terrible customer service,We booked our holiday through a travel agent who then booked us through sense of Africa.  we were due to fly to the safari by cessna aircraft from Nairobi airport which we paid a lot of money for to save us (as they told us) 6 hours driving.  we landed and where told by the guide that we had a five hour journey - they had no idea why we had landed were we were and asked why we didn't fly into the landing strip beside the lodge.  When we asked we were never given an explanation. We then arrived in Zanzibar to our supposedly luxury hotel for 8 nights (this was our honeymoon which we paid thousands which we had saved for) the hotel was not luxury and was no better than a 4 star in Spain.  it was said to be all inclusive but it wasn't.  when we complained it took two days for a representative to contact us.  they said they would sort matter but it was not until two days before we were due to leave that a rep turned up and asked if we wanted to move hotel!!!!!!!!!  we were then told that the matter would be investigates (by Frank) and we would be told what had happened before we left.  that date cam and went.  we then e-mailed sense of Africa and were told to be patient they were still investigating (that was two weeks ago)  we have chased and emailed Pamela Osik and we have yet to receive a response.  never trust this company or pay for anything through them.  the experience has left us feeling duped and seriously out of pocket for what we received. 
Karim,SK,Visited: February 2017,23-Feb-17,35-50,first safari,It Started in Africa,1,Incompetent and deceitful staff ruined our honeymoon,"We decided to book our 9-day luxury safari with It Started in Africa (ISIA) after several emails back and forth. Although the price ($10,100 USD for two people) was more expensive than other companies we had spoken to, we booked with ISIA, as we were impressed by the responsiveness of sales staff.  We did have some concerns about the quality of their vehicles (after reading some reviews on TripAdvisor), but Joao Oliveira (who we later found out is the co-owner), Luis, Iris and Joanna assured us that we would be provided with one of their newer vehicles and a great guide. We were really looking forward to the trip of a lifetime however it turned out be a nightmare.

When we arrived in Kilimanjaro airport, there was no one to pick us up so we had to make several international calls to find out what had happened. They told us that the driver had broken down on route (this turned out to be a lie) and that they were sending a replacement car to pick us up. We waited for 30 minutes outside the airport until the driver finally arrived to pick us up but as soon as we were on the road to Arusha, the police stopped the car for speeding. We then had to wait outside the police station inside the car in blazing temperatures and call ISIA internationally for them to send another driver to pick us up.

We finally arrived at our hotel and I sent an email to Joao to tell him what had happened. He replied that there had been a mix-up with our dates and that the office manager, Bernard Kang¢®?oma would meet us in person to apologise and confirm our itinerary before we left for our Safari. We met with someone the next day who spent 30 minutes claiming to be Bernard Kang¢®?oma despite the fact that I had seen his picture on the company website and knew he was not. When I asked him why he had lied to us, he told us that Bernard Kang¢®?oma had asked him to impersonate him. We wrote to Joao again expressing how unhappy we were with the level of service. He replied that we could cancel the trip but would have to forfeit 50% (over $5000!). Of course he knew that we had no other choice but to continue with the Safari. We could not book anything at such short notice so reluctantly we told him that we would continue with the trip. What followed was a litany of deceit and incompetence:

We started our Safari with two days in Tarangire and had an issue at the gate with the permit, which meant we had to return to the gate the next day early morning to get an extension for the next day. 

The vehicle was old and the fridge cooler was broken so we could not drink cold water. It also had not been cleaned before the trip and stank of rotten food. 

The Nikon binoculars they say they provide all clients is in fact a marketing lie. We had one Russian branded binoculars, which were glued together and belonged to the driver and another pair, which were broken.

We were kept waiting for 30 minutes outside one of our lodges, while they sorted out our booking. When I spoke to the manager that evening he said that he had a booking for us the following day (not the correct day). Another lodge told us they weren't expecting us for lunch despite this being on the itinerary.

While heading to South Serengetti, we were kept waiting 3.5 hours at the gate as there was another problem with the permit. Another mess up by the staff in Arusha meant we missed out on most of the afternoon game drive in the ndutu region. 

Unfortunately, our balloon ride was cancelled due to poor weather, however we were told that we could book for the next day. Immediately upon returning to the camp, I asked the driver to confirm our booking for the next day. We repeatedly asked him to do this throughout the day but it was only when we absolutely insisted that he did so, but by then it was too late as it was already fully booked. We were the only people to miss out on the balloon ride as everyone else had confirmed early and had not left it so late.

When we arrived at our camp in Ngorongoro, we were informed that the camp didn't have a booking for the crater walk that we had paid for. The weather was poor so the walk may not have taken place but again ISIA staff messed up the booking.

Bernard Kang¢®?oma informed us, that we could collect the refund for the cancelled balloon ride and crater walk at the office in Arusha. Our driver/guide spoke to him several times before we left Ngorongoro and Kang¢®?oma confirmed that he would be waiting in the office with the full refund of $1200. When we arrived at the office, Kangoma wasn't there. We tried to reach him several times and when he eventually answered his phone, he said that he had given the money to someone called Daniel who was waiting at Kilimanjaro airport. We called Daniel and he told us that he didn't actually have the money! We then tried to reach Kang¢®?oma but he would just hang up. We had no option but to go to the police station to report this. They called him and told him to come to the police station but we gave up waiting for him and were told by the police to give them our contact details and they would follow up. 

We tried to catch our flight to Zanzibar but missed it because of this incident and had to stay at the airport hotel and catch a flight the next day, losing our hotel booking in Stone town in the process.

When we asked Joao for a refund of the $1200 for the cancelled balloon ride and crater walk, he at first tried to make us sign a letter saying that we would not write negative reviews on any site. He told us that this was his bank¢®?s policy (a lie) but we refused to do this and he reluctantly agreed to pay us the refund by PayPal. We are still waiting to agree compensation but Joao and ISIA staff are not replying to our emails. 

ISIA ruined our honeymoon and we would absolutely not recommend booking a Safari with this company!!! There were several issues everyday which we would spend most of of the day resolving. Terrible organisation and service by ISIA especially considering the price we paid. There are plenty of other good safari companies, so we would suggest using any of them.

Karina,DE,Visited: August 2017,01-Oct-17,50-65,over 5 safaris,Tazama Africa Holidays,2,"an absolutely disappointing and frustrating experience with Tazama Holidays in the Masai Mara, Kenya","I just returned from a 6-nights private Migration Safari with Tazama Holidays in Kenya, quite expensive for a single traveller in a land cruiser. And it was absolutely disappointing!

The aim of my trip was very clear from the beginning on - wildlife photography of the wildebeest migration in the Masai Mara.

But their driver-guide, Eric, first only did classic game drives and only after unpleasant vivid discussions finally took me to the Talek River instead to the requested more important Mara River crossing points, with the result that we only got to see one crossing on the very last day (even though I showed him the exact points on a map!)

This driver of a 'photographic' safari (Tazama's own words) did not know anything about the simplest rules how to position the vehicle. He was very stubborn and did not take lightly to criticism. At any sightings he would spend most of the time on his phone (talking or checking messages). He definitely lacks even the most basic communicative skills (except with fellow drivers) as it proved to be extremely difficult to get any info or feedback. The only positive thinghe is a good driver and game spotter. It might well be that you fare better when going with the owner, Antony, himself. But although this was initially the plan also for my trip, this was changed shortly before leaving. You never know what you get!

Shortly before leaving for the trip Tazama proposed to change accommodation, an intimate eco-bush camp inside the Mara Reserve instead a much bigger one outside the reserve. This proved to be an excellent suggestion. However, also here Tazama disappointed as they stated this new camp would be more expensive, but they would not charge it to me. During my stay, however, I got the info that the bush camp was in fact about 20 percent cheaper - quite a sum for 6 nights which Tazama of course happily kept for themselves.

In short, if you don't ask for anything more than very general 'touristy' game drives and don't mind being ripped off for accomodation rates, if you are fine with a driver who does what he wants and does not communicate, go with Tazama."

KAT,US,Visited: January 2019,08-Jan-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Gatatu Safaris,2,Buyer Beware - Gatatu lied about purchasing our Gorilla and Chimp permits in advance,"After researching a few safari companies, we (group of 4) chose to work with Gatatu as they had great reviews and were a small operation located right in Uganda. Clearly something has changed with their business since these last reviews were posted, as our trip was anything but easy. We came to find out Richard and Steven never purchased our gorilla and chimp permits in advance (we found out about the gorilla permits the morning of our trek when we couldn't get in) in spite of telling us they were purchased back in August 2018, when my sister and I made a $2000 deposit (my friends made a similar deposit but I don't know the date). Richard went as far as providing FAKE copies of the gorilla permits. Please keep in mind gorilla permits and chimp habituation permits HAVE to be booked well in advance as only a limited number of ppl can get in per day. After repeated lies from both Richard (and threats via text) and Steven, we decided to part ways and hired ourselves a new driver 4 nights in. If you choose to use them, make sure to get copies of all of your permits in advance and confirm their validity with the national parks. 

On a positive note, all of our accommodations were what was promised and we did have a nice $30 add on of a boat ride up the Kazinga Channel with one of Steven's friends. Also, with our evidence of being duped by Gatatu, we were able to get ourselves in for a gorilla trek at Bwindi by the game warden who took pity on us and with the assistance of two locals in Kibale, in for the chimp trek (we couldnt get in for habituation as that was full). All I can say is thank goodness we did not pay them in full and were able to walk away with a few saved dollars. If you have any questions, I have saved all of my communication and texts with Richard. Feel free to reach out. 

p.s. Steven picked us up in a green safari vehicle full of roaches on the first day. We should have known what was to come...

Katarzyna Surmiak-Doma?ska,PL,Visited: July 2019,22-Aug-19,50-65,first safari,Gorillas Homeland Safaris,1,complete disaster,"Dear safari lovers and all who are planning holidays in East Africa with the assistance of Gorillas Homeland Safaris. It is pretty likely you will pick  this  tour company as they have a very nice website, perfect ratings, its  manager Mr. Davis Tukamushaba has several FB profiles all packed with only positive comments, and he is very quick in replying to potential customers¢®? inquiries. All this creates a great first impression. 
A month ago we returned from our 8-day safari in Rwanda and Uganda organized by Davis and his team.  Wherein the word ?organized¢®¡¾ is a big exaggeration, as in terms of organizing our trip was a complete disaster. 
It all started on the first night.  After having landed at the Kigali airport around midnight we found that no one  was waiting for us. When we, at last, reached the hotel we learned that Mr. Tukamushaba ¢®¡Æhad forgotten¢®¡¾ to book our stay. In the following days it was only worse. Our personal guide who was to accompany us during the whole trip was late for the first meeting by 6 hours. Despite Mr. Tukamushaba¢®?s claim that all our accommodations and entrances to the national parks had been already paid (in fact we had paid 70 percent of the whole trip in advance ) - ever and again it turned out that something was not paid or even booked. Eventually Davis would always pay ? on short notice - only when we started the alarm on  Messenger. A critical moment was on the day when we were driving 10 hours to the Nyungwe Forest National Park in the south of Rwanda for chimpanzee tracking only to learn that our names are not on the list. This time nothing could be done since all had already been booked. We missed the chimpanzee tracking, which was supposed to be one of the highlights. In the long run Davis returned us the money for the chimpanzees but it didn¢®?t really comfort us. For eight days Davis Tukamushaba - who was in touch with us on the phone - kept on making up extraordinary stories about exceptional misunderstandings and unbelievable coincidences which resulted in this series of fuckups. Instead of relaxing we were stressed every night. 
We decided not to keep this story for ourselves. We feel obliged to share it because of the tourists¢®? solidarity. My friend Izabela is a PR Manager at an American company, I am a journalist and a non-fiction writer. You¢®?ll find us on Facebook, feel free to contact us if you want to learn more details. 
Our unpleasant experience does not change the fact that Rwanda and Uganda are beautiful and fascinating countries. You will meet there many professional and kind people. Simply you¢®?d better think twice before you go there with Gorillas Homeland ?Safaris.

Kate,NZ,Visited: September 2018,23-Sep-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,2,Difficult driver changed the plan,"The pre-tour booking was very efficient.  The tour was simple to book, we were provided great options for accommodation and we were given clear level of detail.  However, unfortunately our experience with the driver was far from positive.  We had booked a full game drive, plus two game drives, but in reality, we were given a full day + 2 hours.  The driver was then disagreeing with us on the second half day, and said that we had to get back to Nairobi.  We are not usually confrontational people, but we felt that it was really unfair to not finish the agreed itinerary.  This made us feel really uncomfortable as we didn't want to be disagreeing on the plan, however, we had flown such a long way for these three days and we really wanted to spend our agreed time in the park.  The driver begrudgingly agreed to take us back into the park, but we only spent 2 hours there, rather than the half day.  What really polished it off was on our way home, we stopped to fill up the tyres and one of our passengers got out to use the rest room.  Before the passenger even got back into the car, the driver started driving out of the petrol station!  He was very rude, didn't make an effort to learn our names and made it apparent that he didn't want to be hosting the trip.  He was also making multiple personal phone calls throughout the trip.  It was really very disappointing. "

The guide was aggressive and lying to us about park-openings, schedule etc. He turned up late 1 hour in the morning, so everyday we missed the best time of the safari.

No respect.,"I was super excited about the safari, and the lady who helped us book was so nice, even our driver to the safari was so nice. The issue was on the second day ( we did only two days one night), logistics was awful. We were told to meet the tour guide at 6 am only to find out, the tour we were suppose to be on left. We spent the next 45 mins in the safari searching for that said group, only to find out they were finished in the park, so we parted the park to return to Nairobi. We were suppose to spend three hours in the safari. All while my husband did not have a seat in the van ( over crowded) so he sat on the floor- literally where you put your feet. When we discussed this with the direct of baboon budget his response was; ¢®¡Æ who told you you would have a seat, you can stand¢®¡¾, which was not of course what we paid for. After some time explaining his only response to our cristicms was, ¢®¡Æ oh you people- I know people like you- you are just never sastified, you just want to complain and get money¢®¡¾. We were of course only relaying our complaints. We ( my husband and I) spent 520.00 usd ( 240 a person, plus surcharge for using debit machine), and spent less than three hours actually touring the safari.

Katie McMahon,US,Visited: March 2020,30-Nov-20,35-50,first safari,Safarihub,2,Do not book with Safarihub,"I do not recommend this company for many reasons.

1) They are not very good at responding to emails (this should have been my first sign to go with another company).  

2) My safari experience (6-Day Kili Safari) guaranteed a 4x4 Land Cruiser.  Instead, for my 6 day safari I was in different dilapidated, falling apart 4x4 vans.  

3) I was given hardly ANY information on my safari.  So little information that when I actually arrived in Kenya, instead of going to Amboseli, then Naivasha, and then Masai Mara, they reversed the itinerary.  Not a big deal except I sent my detailed itinerary to my employer (for security) and my family so they knew how to contact me.  I did not realize the change until I was literally in the van on Sunday morning driving to Masai Mara. Although I was picked up at my hotel early Sunday morning for the start of my safari, I was never, ever given any information on the safari, the itinerary, the drive times, lunch plans, etc.  I can't iterate enough how in the dark was at all times.  I would attempt to ask the guide but he always seemed clueless as to what was happening.

4) Although I booked with Safarihub, a Kenya subcontractor actually handled my safari.  Although they weren't terrible, they weren't great either.  On one day I was shuffled between 3 different vans and 3 different companies to try to get me from Masai Mara to Naivasha.  When I booked this safari for a good amount of money, I assumed I would be dealing with one company and one guide the whole time.  I was very mistaken.  Had I been given a heads up, I would have been better prepared.  But on one of the days, I kept being shuttled between different people and different vans and it made me very uncomfortable, especially as a solo traveler.  The guide could not even tell me how I was getting to Masai Mara to Naivasha the day before I was supposed to go there because he said his boss hadn't figured it out yet!

5) The morning I was picked up to begin my safari adventure, I was told we would all meet at Somak Lounge.  Wrong!  Instead I was taken to a street in downtown Nairobi and put in another van.  No briefing, no food, no drinks, no lounge, just straight into a random van to start our journey.  I was already pretty apprehensive due to the recent terrorist threats.  Having me driven to a random street in downtown Nairobi without any check-in or anything was pretty scary.  Basically, everything that was promised to me did not happen, except the lodging and parks (which were all amazing!!!).  

6) I had been provided a detailed itinerary with the plans each day.  That was complete BS.  We never once followed the itinerary - in fact, the sub contracting company said they were never provided with my itinerary so had no idea I had been promised certain things.  For instance, I was supposed to make it to Amboseli in time for an evening game drive - never happened.  I was supposed to have early morning game drives followed by breakfast back at the lodging - never happened, not once.  In their defense, two of the 6 days we had 10 hour game days so didn't have time to come back for breakfast or lunch but it would have been nice to know that was the plan beforehand.  Communication is key.  Why promise me something if you don't intent to honor it?

7) My contract specifically states ""We also take pride in our safari vehicle fleet, which is young (less than 3 years old) and well maintained; consequently, breakdowns and other mechanical complications while you are on safari will be rare.""  This is a complete lie.  The vans we were in were extremely old and falling apart.  On the drive from Naivasha to Amboseli, our van broke down and we were stuck on the side of the road for over an hour.  It would have been longer but a nice driver from another safari company (Jockey - the guests in that van recommended their company) gave me a ride to Amboseli Sopa Lodge (2 hrs away).  Also, while on safari in Masai Mara our van broke down but I think they may have had something to do with stopping so much to look at animals so I can't fault them for that.  

8)  Each morning (except for the last 2 mornings) the guides were at least 25 mins late to pick me up.  As mentioned above, I had so many different guides and van drivers that it was hard to keep them straight.  However, my last guide/driver (Francis) was AWESOME and the highlight of my whole trip!  The rest were not good at all.

9) In conclusion, I do not recommend Safarihub.  I spent about $1,500 on this 6 day, 5 night Kili safari for a single traveler but it was such a logistical nightmare and communication was so bad with Safarihub, I do not recommend them.  I do realize if I had paid more money, I probably would have gotten a better company, so if you are short cash, then I will say that nothing takes away from the animals and the Sopa Lodges - they both were fantastic.  But you might want to think about looking at other companies if you can."
Kaushik Mitra,IN,Visited: July 2018,08-Aug-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Kenya,2,Wildlife is a great host for the human guests.,"Masai Mara, the name itself holds its own identity around the globe. It's a paradise for wildlife lovers. This was the very sentences which used to ring in my head before entering beautiful Kenya. And if I was to rate Kenya after my visit, on a scale of 5 then I would have given 6, leaving besides the bitter experience with our tour operator #tourkenyasafariheights, just because of them my rating would go down to 2. 
       Before travelling to Kenya, I and my friend searched on internet several times about tour operators conducting safaris. From them we shortlisted a few and ultimately finalized  #tourkenyasafariheights. The agreed with the price us on all the criteria demanded by us without any terms and conditions. 
         It was a 6N7D tour which included as promised by #tourkenyasafariheights :
Day 1Nairobi - Maasai Mara National Reserve

At 07:30 to 08:00, you will be picked up from your hotel and depart for the Maasai Mara National Reserve via the viewpoint of the Great Rift Valley and Narok Town for refueling and lunch. Afterward, you will proceed to the game reserve, arriving at the camp at 14:00. You will then have a little siesta and proceed on the first introduction game viewing at Maasai Mara National Reserve. You will return back to Masai ole moran

Day 2Maasai Mara National Reserve

After breakfast, you will proceed on a full day game viewing within the reserve. The landscape is scenic savannah grassland on rolling hills. Maasai Mara National Reserve is the best park for game viewing in Kenya as it has an extensive road and track network which allows for close range viewing and photography. After the game viewing, you can have a break for your picnic lunch at the hippo pool, looking out for hippos and crocodiles. The dinner will be served and you will stay overnight at the Masai ole moran

Day 3Maasai Mara National Reserve - Nakuru

Early in the morning, you will have a pre-breakfast game drive. After breakfast, you will depart the Mara Region for Nakuru and have lunch en-route with scenic views of Mount Longonot and Lake Naivasha from afar on the main highway. The dinner and overnight stay will at Flamingo Hill Camp

Day 4Lake Nakuru National Park - Amboseli National Park

After breakfast, you will proceed on a game drive at Lake Nakuru National Park, known for its prolific birdlife including flamingoes. The park contains a sanctuary for the conservation of white rhinos while species like Cape buffalos and waterbucks can be seen near the shoreline. Afterward, you will drive to Amboseli National Park arriving late in the evening with game viewing en route to the camp. The dinner and overnight stay will be at  Kibo Safari Camp

Day 5Amboseli National Park

You will have a full day of game drives in this park which contains swampy grounds in which elephants and hippos bathe in abundance. A variety of plains game, antelopes, and birds can also be seen. You can also see Mount Kilimanjaro¢®?s peak if weather conditions permit. Tour Kenya Safari Heights will cater for your picnic lunch before returning to  Kibo Safari Camp

 

Day 6Amboseli National Park - Nairobi

In the early morning, you will have a game viewing activity and then return to the LODGE for a full breakfast. Later on, you will be transferred back to Nairobi.


      But, what was delivered to us was very different. Not a single pre-breakfast game drive was given to us and all the accommodations as promised by the #tourkenyasafariheights were changed. We used to stay @ about 45-30 mins distance from the main park entrance,because of which I felt time was wasted and I could have enjoyed more. Whereas the accommodations which were promised are very near to the entrance of the parks/inside the parks. 
          Everyday inbetween 2 parks the car driver of #tourkenyasafariheights would float new names of hotel in which they would provide accommodations for us. Which was really depressing and disturbing at the same time. Because of such uncertainties we failed to enjoy the beautiful scenery of the mountains and the lakes on our way.
         Furthermore, I would like to mention that #tourkenyasafariheights had promised through messages on on our personal number. That #tourkenyasafariheights would provide lodging at a proper place for us at @Nairobi on the day we arrived and on the day we would depart. Which would be included in the package. It was very disappointing that on the day we arrived they provided accommodations for us @ hotel sunrise which is a pathetic hotel, location is not good. And on the day we arrived @Nairobi after completion of the tour , #tourkenyasafariheights refused to provide any accommodations which was further more disappointing in a foreign land. 
        Finally, I would suggest to tourists/travellers arriving 1st time.  It is just because of the nature's own gift to the land that inspite of such irregularities I would suggest you to visit the place again and again. But be careful with such tour operators and ensure your bookings personally with the hotels which are promised initially by such tour operators. "
Ken,JP,Visited: January 2023,21-Jan-23,20-35,first safari,Migration Venture Africa,1,"Great experience excluding tour guide, Mr.Noely","Yes, I and my wife could see a lot of animals including all Big5 in this tour, it was great for us.
We got satisfied with it.

But our tour guide, Mr.Noely, his attitude to us was terrible, he ruined our experience.
We're really regret choosing this tour ant giving Mr.Noely tips.

The biggest reason why we're thinking so, is that he denied our religion.
In a convesation, we taught him that many people in our country believe in Buddhism.
He said to us,

"" I HATE BUDDHA.""

.....What ?? Why can he deny the religion others believe in ??
If you dislike other religion, you must not tell others that.
(We didn't say anything about his comment because we already understood his terrible humanity at that time, and of course we were afraid that he could abandon his responsibility to let us see animals tomorrow.)

The second reason is, he perfectly blamed his traffic violation on us.
He committed a traffic violation because we didn't fasten seatbelt on back seat of a car, and he had to pay the fine of it.
Then his attitude to us got terrible, drove dangerously with many tsk, and told us anything in a car.
Yes, it's true that we didin't fasten seatbelt, but that was because it's NOT illegal in our country, besides he NEVER told us ""fasten your seatbelt.""
Finaly, we decided that we gave him money ..... to save our lives and the rest of our tour.

There're so many other reasons why Mr.Noely 's humanity was terrible, but the margin is too narrow to contain it.

According to him, Mr.Noely have a 3 years-old daughter.
You must be an adult, because your child always see how parents behave, listen to what parents say."
Kerry,KE,Visited: August 2015,28-Aug-15,50-65,2-5 safaris,Instinct Safaris,1,Disappointing,"Our initial communication with Instinct Safari was good however once in Africa it was definitely downhill. About three days before we were due to fly into Uganda we received the following email. 


As the DR Congolese single entry visa is not officially part of our included services, please let us know if you have already applied for it on www.visitvirunga.org and have a confirmation. If, however, you did not yet do so, please let us know (we would further require your job title - in addition to the passport copies we already have - to fill out their online form) and we do it for you. Please understand, that in that case we have to charge the extra US $105 per person they ask for their single entry visa.As your safari lies only a week ahead, please provide us with the requested information as soon as possible.

This was very disturbing as in every correspondence prior to this they had said the following 

The DR Congo visas are usually purchased by us as the tour operator simply because details such as border checkpoint and address in DRC etc. have to be submitted during the application process. 
.......Highest priority is assigned to the activities in DR Congo, now. With your passport photocopies at hand, it is easy for us to proceed and acquire your travel visas along with the volcano hike.

In this instance I contacted the Director who to his credit rectified this but it did add stress as we had limited internet access at this stage. 

The day before we flew in we received another email explaining that we would need a special type of sleeping bag and parkas for sub zero conditions to prevent us suffering Hypothermia while trekking up to the volcano. 
The packing list we had received before we left home did not mention this. 
Decidedly unimpressed on arrival the guide not for the last time said it wasn't his fault as he had only just received the information himself, although later in the conversation he said he had been to the volcano a number of times before so I'm not sure why the company would not know what you need. 
He did explain this situation could also be solved!!!!!
The car they picked us up in was really really old we had just come from a self drive safari in Namibia where we had no dust in the car. 
The guide was EXTREMELY difficult to understand his English was poor and his attitude poorer. 
He had minimal text book knowledge of the area. Quite honestly I think he and the driver thought it was their holiday. Soon as we arrived at places they would take off and chat with people . There were many instances where either ourselves or someone else would have to search for them. 
Communication was almost non existent at the second lodge on arrival he just took off to relax in the lounge . Other guests thought they were also guests there, enthused to tell us some other tourists staying there were travelling to the Congo. 

After we trekked with the Golden Monkeys we were supposed to go back to the lodge for a shower and lunch. They were particularly agitated and wanted us to be ready in 30 minutes?! 
They then drove dangerously to the Congo border. I kept asking why we didn't cross the Congo border that was quite near. He just kept saying it was unacceptable. We finally arrived at the border he was on the phone and then said it was to late to cross. I then asked to speak to the lodge owner who told me she had expected us at 8.30am and had emailed him this information. He had had wifi access at the lodge. She said you can't drive in the Congo at night. One wonders why a company would create an itinerary that is unachievable as we were always trekking golden monkeys that day, the lodge owner was very helpful and suggested we stay just across the border. He instead checked us in at a hotel on the Rwanda side. I asked him to confirm this with her. He assured me he would. Next day we crossed the border my daughter and I were standing on the side of the road with all our gear, yet again they were nowhere to be found. My daughter eventually located them sitting out the back chatting with friends. The driver was late but they hadn't bothered to tell us. As it turns out they had gone to the hotel they thought we were staying at!!!!! ( the one they recommended)
We had consequently held everyone up to start the trek up the volcano. Again on arrival no explanation that we could put some belongings in bags that had been provided for us. We had been told we would each be provided with a porter but they were carrying our sleeping gear not our belongings. The food for the day was two warm ham sandwiches which would have been in the sun for at least four hours before consumption and a non refrigerated boiled egg. Although they were not responsible for the food they did not care about resolving the situation. During the trek the driver and guide spent most of their time taking selfies at one point when my daughter slipped they laughed and kept walking. 
At one stage the cook asked the guide to come over and interpret but he was busy taking photos and initially said ""no ""until the chef demanded it. 

I could add more . I spent six weeks in Africa and have travelled extensively and love travel . This guide / company were the worst I have ever experienced. 

Do yourself a favour and pick someone else . Having said that the treks we did were fantastic and with another company I would highly recommend the gorillas golden monkeys and volcano in DR Congo.

Kevin,AT,Visited: July 2018,30-Jul-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Angose Travel Limited,1,Utmost disappointing,"I have been on a 4 day Safari in 2015. Same route, same price, different company, amazing experience.

So I wanted to share this experience with my girlfriend but this time unfortunately the safari was not good at all due to very poor organization and customer care.

So I booked with a company called ""Goshawk Tours"". The Safari they offered sounded quite exactly like the one I did three years ago and it was about the same price (50?©¡ more expensive this time). A guy named Eric sent me a few emails and I told him that we need to be transfered to Kilimanjaro airport on the last day of safari because we already booked the flight. The transfer was another 50$.

We spent the week before safari on Zanzibar and there i got a text from Eric. He said he will not be there next week so his business partner Ibrahim will organize it ""just as we agreed"".

So we travelled to Arusha and spent the night in a hotel and the next day we were supposed to get picked up at the hotel. We did, around 30 minutes late and then we were taken to the office. I was suprised because it was the office of Angose Travel Limited. There we met 2 other girls who also came with us. So we were sitting in the office and it passed another 1 hour until the driver arrived and we headed to Tarangire National park. It was agreed that we will go there pitch up at tent, go on a quick game drive before we get lunch at the campsite and the head for another game drive after lunch.
This was not the case. Our guide, an elderly gentleman called Adrian who was not the talkative kind of guy went really slowly to the park. All the other cars were overtaking and when we went uphill we hardly moved faster than 10 km/h. But this was not really the drivers fault. Because as it turned out later, the car was in a dangerously poor condition.
So we arrived in the afternoon at Tarangire National Park, we didn't pitch up a tent, we went directly in the park, where we were for only about 3 hours. Very disappointing, because we could have seen so much more. The driver just said ""This is enough for today."". We disagreed. We headed for Sunblight Campsite where we got a room. But it was so dirty that we hoped we could've slept in a tent as agreed. Dinner was good. The driver said breakfast 8pm, departure 9pm.

After a loud night with hardly any sleep we had breakfast and then we went to the car. The driver and the cook were already inside, engine running and they said, they will come back soon. So they drove off. A lot of time passed until they came back and when we left the campsite it was already 11am!!
It was agreed that we would have an early game drive in Tarangire Park on this day again but that was not the case at all. When we left, we headed directly to the Serengeti. Going annoyingly slowly we lost a lot of time on the way there.
At the gate of Ngorongoro coservation area the driver had to patch a tire because there was brake fluid leaking out of it.
We were promised an evening game drive after pitching the tent but all we really saw were some animals on the way to the campsite where we arrived so late, that we had to pitch up the tent in the dark. By the way, 2 of 4 tents were broken and we had hardly had any hooks to place the tents so the driver just said ""2 hooks are enough"".
After that there was no game drive. So we had no game drive in the morning, no game drive in the evening. We had no game drive at all this day!!!

Next day we missed the sunrise in the Serengeti which we were promised because the driver didn't want to start so early. So we finally headed out for our game drive. The driver often took the wrong path and we got lost so many times (he said he was a guide for 30 years which i found hard to believe after that). Unfortunately we didn't see too many animals and when we came across some we had to yell STOP so many times until he finally did so. After a short drive we headed to a tourism center where we got an informational tour. It was nice but not really neccessary. Instead we would have prefered to see more of the Serengeti itself, not hear from it. After that we had to drive directly to the camp, pack up and leave for Ngornongoro Crater. It just felt so unsatisfying because we had so little time. On the way out, the driver asked the chef where to go at every crossroad. So we left Serengeti and headed to the crater at snail's pace. When we arrived at the camp, it was already dark and the guide and the cook didn't help us to put up the broken tents in the dark at first. So we had to tell them a couple of times that we need help until they finally did so. There was again no possibility to take a shower because it was already dark and freezing cold.

So we thought it couldn't be any worse but then the last day of safari came.

We got up early this time to descend the crater so we will be out in time to get to Arusha. On the way we had to get diesel but on the way to the gas station the car already ran out of gas and we stopped in an uphill grade. The car didn't have any hand break so he sent one of us to get one big rock and put it behind one of the back wheels. Then he went off to get the gas. After half an hour later he returned with a maasai who helped us to get the car running again. So we were late once again and I had a really bad feeling about getting OUT of the crater again with this car. So we had a game drive in the crater and left with quite some delay because the driver didn't know where he was going. Remember - we had to catch a flight in the evening.
So on the way up the car broke down again. But this time he didn't get it running again. And again we were standing in a really steep uphill grade with only one rock to prevent us from rolling backwards into our certain death.
So a car that stopped behind us took us to a place called Wildlife Lodge. I called Ibrahim, the guy from the office, a couple of times and he said there will be a rescue car coming for us. I also told him that I want them to refund the money for the flight if we wouldn't make it in time and he only said he won't because he didn't know of any flight (Eric said Ibrahim would organize everything just as we agreed, so he must have known of the flight). Anyway, after about 1.5 hours the car finally arrived and we already had a huge delay and we though we wouldn't make it. Furthermore the driver said he will only drive us to Arusha and from there we will get another car. On the way there we had to stop at the gate of Lake Manyara National park to pick up 2 other tourists from the UK and Spain who also went with Angose. They were also really disapointed with the organization and they also had a bad driver and the car was also in bad shape.
So after around 3 hours we arrived at rush hour in Arusha and we only had little time to get to the airport. We got in the other car and this driver was our rescue! After the traffic jam in Arusha he went up to 160 km/h to get to the airport in time. There could have gone so much wrong. The seatbelts didn't work and he was going really fast over speedbumps, overtaking left and right but we were used to nearly getting killed anyway. But because of him we arrived just in time! 10 minutes later and we would have missed the flight. When we got out he called Ibrahim who told me that Eric and I agreed that the airport transfer will be 50$. Weird. He didn't know of any flight but he knew of the money. We had no time to argue so I gave the money to the driver.
The other 5 guys from our car stayed in Arusha and went to the company to complain and they got 50$ back each. They told us so I texted Ibrahim that I also want my money back. He agreed, but only sent it via Mpesa (mobile phone transaction via local phones). So asked him to send it to my brother of my host family in Dar. There will be large fees now when transfers the money to my bank account now.

Summing up, it is really sad that the one thing you are really looking forward to the whole year is getting ruined by very bad organization and customer care. There could have gone so much wrong and we have been in some really dangerous situations due to non-existent maintainance. I'm asking myself - where does all the money go to? I know a lot goes into the admission for the park but the rest?
Our guide, well, for doing this job for 30 years he shared almost no knowledge with us and it often seemed that he just would not care.
The cook, Zaidi (I hope the spelling is right) was a nice guy. The food was ok. Even though it has almost always been quite the same.

Because of all that all of us were utmost disappointed. And we wouldn't recommend booking with Angose at all."
Kevin,US,Visited: June 2018,24-Jun-18,20-35,over 5 safaris,Self Drive Uganda,2,Two different negative experiences: (1) vehicle and driver did not show up and (2) we missed flight,"I would NOT RECOMMEND Self Drive Uganda based on two separate experiences that were both costly and unpleasant.

(1) Upon arrival, there was no driver or vehicle to pick me up. This occurred despite extensive conversation and confirmation with the company beforehand. This put me in a pickle for my gorilla trek the following morning, which I could not reschedule. I ended up hiring a taxi driver for $200+. Self Drive Uganda eventually sent a driver, charging me for the tank of gas to come meet me. They never provided an apology or acknowledgement of their error.

(2) About one year later, I returned for another gorilla trek. The drive was quoted at 5-6 hours long, which was consistent with Google Maps and my previous experience. Despite having packed lunches and my family saying ¢®¡Æwe are fine,¢®¡¾ our driver suggested that we stop for a ¢®¡Æquick lunch¢®¡¾ while he allegedly patched the spare tire. He stated that he would be ¢®¡Æback in 20 minutes¢®¡¾ given that we had ¢®¡Æplenty of time before our flight.¢®¡¾ He returned 1hr 20min later. We proceeded to hit rush hour traffic at the border crossing and then again in downtown Kigali. From start to finish, it took us 10 hours (9:15am to 7:15pm) to get to the airport, in comparison to the 5-6 hours quoted. We missed our flight by 30mins, which caused us to forfeit $700+ in previously booked flights, and then we had to purchase new tickets at $1,275. I am suspicious that our driver went and saw his wife and child as our lunch break also happened to be in the town where he lived. Once again, there was no apology or acknowledgement offered by management. Instead, management berated me over email for allegedly shorting them $15 in payment (which was their mistake). For context, the $15 ¢®¡Æissue¢®¡¾ was literally 1% of the added (and unnecessary) financial setback that Self Drive Uganda caused me. It was a mistake to stop for lunch, we were lied to, and the driver grossly underestimated how long the drive back could take at this time of day, knowing that we had a flight to catch.

I gave two stars because (1) the trip went well otherwise, (2) the vehicles were reliable, and (3) the driver was polite.

I deducted three stars because (1) no driver or vehicle there at pickup, (2) driver¢®?s poor decision-making cost us $1300 in missed flight expenses plus new hotel expenses, and (3) a consistent unwillingness to provide an apology for company errors, that to me are both inexcusable."
Kevin,US,Visited: November 2013,04-Jan-14,20-35,first safari,Trans Kibo Travels,1,"The skeleton outline is there... you see animals, but in my opinion the service is pretty bad","So I will start this review with you will see a lot of animals. It has nothing to do with the guides they use really, the route they take never go far off the beaten path and once a guide finds something interesting all the other landcruisers and landrovers will soon be there. Just the same, by going to these areas you will see some amazing things. I would just advise you use another company. This group incorporates other names, perhaps in an effort to disperse bad reviews around to different groups. MJ safaris is one group that uses or combines with Trans Kibo.

This really regards the service provided by the company. It was a budget safari so initially I chalked up most of what you are about to read as related to that. However, on meeting several other people who took budget tours from Arusha it became very clear the service was sub-par even for a budget tour. 
1. Our guide was non-talkative. He did not point out many animals and it took us prompting him to get him to speak. There were other passengers who were rude to him but he did not talk much. 
2. The food was the same for four people as it was for two people. We noticed this cause two of us were alone the last day and the food was the same and much more filling. Multiple times we were hungry in between meals those first two days. 
3. The big deal was how much we waited. We waited for many hours to enter the park with excuses like our bank is not transferring money, our credit card is not working still. This also applied to leaving one of the campsites. We waited every morning while other tours left. We were regularly the first to arrive in the afternoon and the last to leave in the morning. This amounted to at least 5-6 hours less drive time for a four day tour then other budget operators. 

All in all, just really poor service. When a component of your tour is a bank, and they consistently mess up, the answer is not to blame them but find another group who doesn't F-up all the time. 

After I contacted my operator and never received any response. So now I'll just recite my story here."

Kili Trekker,NL,Visited: October 2014,20-Nov-14,35-50,first safari,David & Goliath Tours Safaris,1,David and Goliath Tours - Beware of the Thief !!!!,"I have just returned from a Kilimanjaro Trek booked with David and Goliath Tours.
We booked with David's company after a local recommendation as we liked the idea of our money going straight into the local economy.
We asked David to arrange an 8 day trek (usually 7 days) to give us an extra day to acclimatise (an additional US$150 each for the extra day).
We agreed an itinerary and paid US$350 deposit each into David's Bank account.
4 days before the trek, David advised us that in addition to the cash balance, we also needed to bring just over US$400 each for tips for the mountain team.
I became suspicious and even more so when David wouldn't give us a receipt for the balance we paid to him in cash when we arrived.
However, the hotel was fine and we were picked up the next day for the start of our trip.

At the National Park entrance, David dropped us off and then disappeared completely.
There was also a shortfall of US$10 for the park fees which I had no option but to pay on my credit card.
And when we signed in, we had to sign in for 7 days which we were told was the standard trek duration.
I was even more suspicious.

The trek itself was fantastic.
The mountain team of 15 people were brilliant and we had a great time.
But we could never get an answer about the extra day.
We did however all reach the summit which we were really thrilled about.

On our descent, this is where our suspicions became reality.
We found out from the mountain team that the trek WAS for 7 days and when we complained, they said David would make everything right (would this explain why some of the team were on their mobile phones a lot ???).

We reached the exit gate where David met us.
We told him straight away that we were a day short.
He didn't explain.

Back at the hotel, we asked for a meeting with David and politely asked for a refund of the US$150 each for the extra day we didn't get.
This is where David changed.
He became very aggressive, told lie after lie (he said we had told the guides we wanted to come off the mountain a day early and he had only been notified the night before), and refused to give us our money back.
As he became more angry we realised we weren't going to get our refund.
We felt we had no option but to pay the mountain team their tips who had now been waiting almost 2 hours in the hotel reception.

David then came back and had the cheek to ask us for more money.
We sent him packing.

Although we had a great time on the Trek, I would not recommend David and Goliath tours to anyone thinking of using this company to book a holiday.
David is far from honest, he is not trustworthy and I believe that, if given the chance, would not hesitate to take money from tourists and not deliver what has been paid for.

In future, we will never use a local company for any type of holiday. 

It has left us with a bad impression of Tanzania.

Kimberly Endicott,US,Visited: April 2019,26-Jan-23,50-65,2-5 safaris,Wild Frontiers Uganda Safaris,1,No follow through,"I was kidnapped while on a game drive in Queen Elizabeth national park in Uganda. I purchased my tour through natural word safaris and they brokered it out to wild frontiers. No one was at the airport to meet me when I first arrived in Entebbe by myself. I did get to  gorilla trek for two days and then the third day I was kidnapped. I was held at gunpoint from April 2 , taken into the democratic republic of Congo, held by four men with machine guns and a fifth man who only had a machete. I was recovered on April 7 by the American Embassy in uganda. My guide was taken with me most likely he was involved & this tour company sold my photos all over the media. They made my incredibly horrific trauma the whole world¢®?s business. They never followed through on contacting when I got home as they said they would to see how I was doing.  like everyone else they wanted to distance themselves from the terrifying experience that happened while I was in there care, or lack there of. They did not provide any security yet somehow I was ,in the media, held responsible for no security being available. since they sold my photos I can only assume that they were part of that propaganda. This company let me take the fall for what happened just outside of their  camp with their tour guide. They should have done more, much more when they said they would. The loss to my life , both personally and professionally, Has been in measurable and PTSD my constant companion. Know who your are traveling with in dangerous places. Natural world safaris has tried to victim shame me for reviewing my experience and their deplorable behavior, let¢®?s see what this company does. "
Kira,DE,Visited: October 2018,14-Nov-18,20-35,first safari,African Habitat Safaris,1,No help in problematic situations with Tanzanian subcontractor. Poor!,"We booked a 5 day Tanzania safari (lake manyara, Serengeti, ngorogoro) through African habitat safaris who ended up subcontracting to Sandland. We prepaid 25% and were supposed to pay the rest in cash on arrival which we did. We then started our tour in a completely old car with a driver for one day of the 5 day tour, since the other driver was not available on the day of departure. 
We then took of to Make manyara where we were lucky seeing lots of animals, however not so lucky with our guide. He seemed utterly disinterested and at was constantly either talking on the phone or checking Facebook. Once when we stopped to look for elephants and looked down because we heard some weird noise from his phone we even caught him watching porn. 
When we arrived at our lodge for that night (Manyara wildlife lodge- amazing place) the bill was not paid and we had to wait 90 minutes for the matter to be resolved. And thus began the nightmare...
Next morning we were picked up by our new driver, Deo, who was with us for the rest of the trip, and picked up another couple from GB.
When we arrived at Serengeti entrance it turned out, that Sandland had not paid for admission so the shady guy from Sandland, Abraham, had told the British couple to settle their outstanding balance by paying the park fees. Turned out they were paying for all four of us. Here again, we were facing considerable waiting time to resolve things. After game viewing we arrived at our 2 night accommodation Kenzan tented camp (lovely place!) Where after 2 nights it had turned out - surprise - that there was an outstanding balance (which Abraham probably did not pay until this day). Luckily they let us leave based on Abrahams hollow promises, however, we had gotten up super early to do sunrise early game drive which we then missed due to having to settle this open balance. 1000 thanks to the Kenzan people for their understanding!
We then drove direction Ngorogoro where, at Serengeti exit point we had an unsettled open fee again, however everyone had at this point in time fully paid off their safari. We spent 4! hours where Deo, and all of us tries to resolve this matter with all sorts of people - Abraham himself, Derrick/Simon/Rachel from African habitat, however Abraham was only making false promises (he probably had already spent all our money on other things) and the people from African habitat were completely useless and said it was not their fault and we should talk to Abraham. Honestly, if you subcontract someone you are still responsible for a service that YOU sell to someone! 
After not being able to settle the issue, we decided to overpay in order to leave and get to Ngorogoro before nine. 600$ on top and we had to drive in the dark (not the nicest thing with all the animals around). We arrived at Rhino lodge and instantly asked whether accommodation had been paid. Surprise-it had not. 
However, they let us leave the next morning to see Ngorogoro based on Abrahams false promises that it would be paid by 8 in the morning. 
After game drive we drove direction Lake Manyara again, however, at Ngorogoro gate they had gotten word from Rhino lodge that the accommodation had not been paid and so they would not let us leave and even confiscated the car!!! 
After 2 hours of more calls and discussions we convinced the people there that we would drive straight to the police in Arusha and they let us go. 
People like Abraham and Sandlands should be in Prison for the way they operate and companies like African Habitat should have to take responsibility for who they are subcontracting. 
Name of the Sandland  guy is Abraham Shaidi in case he changes his name or anything. Stay clear of this guy!!! And should you still want to do safari with African habitat, make sure who they subcontract to since they will not take responsibility! Neither Rachel, nor Derrick, nor Simon were of any help. Whenever the situation got bad they stopped replying on WhatsApp or were suddenly offline... poor behaviour"
Knut Bartl,DE,Visited: October 2018,11-Feb-19,65+,over 5 safaris,Shoebill SAFARIS,1,This trip cannot be recommended at all.,"This trip was completely unpleasant.The problem was the guide Abdul, the name GUIDE he does not deserve: unpolite, rude, egoistic, ill-tempered.He even did not know about my program that I have booked and payed. I had to tell him and fight for my program to be executed. Since I travelled with him alone I finally decided to accept everything he wanted to do, to avoid to make completely my trip a desastrious trip, not having any communication with him any more.  This was not only my assessment.  Two other groups offered me to join their groups  and to leave Abdul.The high price of 2580 $ was completely overpaid because of this. I am thinking of asking for recompensation. I should have chosen Red Chilly Hideaway in Kampala as my alternative.
I cannot recommend tis trip at all.

KOH,SG,Visited: June 2023,30-Jun-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,MoAfrika Tours,2,Inattentive to details and lack of commitment to deliver,"We booked a total of 11d 10n trip with MOAFRIKA.

Overall experience was acceptable but there are a lot of rooms for improvement in terms of service level to suffice the basic expectation of a customer. 
communication, commitment, attentiveness and etc.

1) booked on full day Soweto tour 4 months ago but was informed 1 day before the tour that apartheid museum is closed on Tuesday. Ended up not able to visit the museum. Was told that we could try make up for it on other days after the safari but no follow up from MOAFRIKA at all. The opening of the museum should have been known to any local tour operator. How could this even possibility overlooked?

2) for our trip to green field lodge, MOAFRIKA sublet us on other transport company which had 4 more other stops to drop off from south before us at north. Our overall transport duration from joburg airport to Greenfire gate took us approx. 10hours. 0700 - 1700hrs. This leaded us to miss our afternoon game drive at 1530hrs. The driver/ MOAFRIKA should already know that this route the van is taking will not get us to Greenfire in time. This could be avoided if driver could drop us first at north before routing down south to drop others. 
The transfer from Greenfire gate to Greenfire lodge takes 45mins. MOAFRIKA should have known and find us a transport to bring us there within 7hours which means it would be a direct transfer in order for us to reach the gate by 1400HRS to be transferred into Greenfire lodge, checked in and ready for the game drive.

I had to personally inform MOAFRIKA that we are not going to make it in time and all I get was ok, I will inform the lodge. No effort to try on compensating this loss caused by their miss planning.

3) photos of the room at tremisan game lodge safari presented to us in quotation is misleading. We were allocated a small room as compared to the one we were presented when receiving the quotation. Feed-backed to MOAFRIKA and was informed that the receptionist will try to make adjustment for us. Went to the receptionist to follow up on next morning. Disappointed to hear¢®¡Æat the moment, we are very full. I¢®?ll try my best to change the room but no promise. All my guest booked a year in advance. If you have specific room, you need to let us know. ¢®¡Æ
Well, all we are asking is only what we have been offered before and nothing more. But she sounded that it¢®?s our fault and we should be shortchanged due to her being full.

4) there is no proactiveness from MOAFRIKA to share driver/ PIC contact detail 1 day prior to any trip. I had to follow up on my own and at times I had to wait for them to get back.

Kosta,NL,Visited: September 2017,02-Oct-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,Faustin Tour and Travel,1,Avoid this guy!!!,"Attention, be very careful with Faustin!!! I can't recommend this tour operator at all!!! We have never experienced such a disaster before. The tour was a nightmare!!! The organisation was terrible. 

The driver left us in Mikumi at the Hotel, on the last day returning back and disappeared into thin air!!! Faustin and driver would not pick up the phone since then! We were left alone and had to go back by ourselves to dar!!!!!!!! Luckily it was not our day of the departure, else we would have missed the flight back home!

We reported this incident to the Police and the Tanzania Tour Association as well as the National Park Administration!

But let me tell you the whole story...

...My girlfriend and I, booked a 5-day Mikumi and Selous private tour. Faustin was recommended by friends, who made a 9day luxury safari. Faustin and his driver John picked us up with the car ready to start the tour. Once we paid him the full amount cash (by the way we never received a bill) he left the car telling us that he is not going to join the tour with us. If we knew before, we would have canceled.

Alone with the driver we soon realized, that John wasn't speaking English at all. Luckily my girlfriend is from Kenia and speaks Swahili. Even though John was not talking to us, he was just driving like a robot. No conversation, no stories, no jokes, no social interaction. In fact, he was texting all the time and even stopped to handle some private business while we were waiting for him in the car. Being scared of getting a fine he drove 40km/h although the speed limit is 50km/h. Can you imagine how long a 5-day-trip can get with someone like that! 

John was just the driver, he had no clue about the daily planned program. He asked us, what to do next, instead vice versa. We had to coordinate the trip with the local guides ourselves, who were also shocked with Johns behavior. He littered in the national park. In the national park, during safari he jumped many times out of the car while talking on the phone, although advice differently by the guides as it is forbitten by the rangers. He scared away animals and spoiled pictures. He had no patience and was bored quickly. At some point, after a long wait, trying to get a good pic, he decided to drive off. At this point I lost my calm and had an argument with him. Because he didn¢®?t understand English, he thought we insulted him. 

A regular (taxi) driver with no safari experience would have done the job with more passion and care.

We booked a regular tour, but Faustin delivered less than promised. He cut our program short. He is profit oriented but delivers a really bad service and showed a very unprofessional behavior!!!!!!

During the whole tour, he never got in direct contact with us, although we expressed some concerns. Maybe he will do that now, through this platform. I'm curious to see his response.

After the driver dumped us in Mikumi, locals told us, that Faustin is known for this tricky behavior. He owes local guides/drivers money. He doesn't pay them their full salary. 

If you are thinking of doing a safari-tour check the safaribookings.com for the best rated company. I strictly advise you not to ignore my review.

Kristin,US,Visited: January 2019,18-May-19,35-50,first safari,Gombe Track Safaris & Tours,2,Beware of what you are getting into!,"We were very disappointed in this tour. Starting out with being picked up late at the airport. We arrived in the pouring rain with no cell phone service and the driver was 15 minutes late in picking us up, which would not have been a big deal if we had a way of getting ahold of someone to see if they were coming or had forgotten us. 
 
Secondly, the driver was drunk from the impression I got. He drove those roads at 120kph which I finally had to tell him to slow down. These are dirt/ clay roads! There was a man on a bicycle carrying long wooden sticks which the driver hit as he drove by the man! I know I'm in a different country but is this a normal occurrence? He proceeded to tell us we would be in the car for 6 hours...? Now, I'm confused because the itinerary I was sent said:
""Transfer to Sigunga village where you will take a boat to Mahale mountain national park. Have a picnic lunch at Sigunga village before boating to Mahale. The boat will take approximately 3 to 4 hours""
As we drove at top speeds we came to a village where we were told he had forgotten dinner and would be right back. 30 minutes later he returns with a chicken and throws him in the back of the car. After driving for 3 hours I ask about lunch because it's now 3pm. He hands me a box lunch which was not vegetarian like I had said  several times that I was. I could not eat! I had a banana. At 630pm we arrive at this boat in the middle of nowhere. There is 1 man waiting to take us to Mahale. This is scary for 2 women traveling alone, especially with my sister who has anxiety. If we had been informed ahead of time what was going to be going on we would have felt more comfortable. Especially since it took 7+ hours to get there when we were thinking it was a 3hr boat ride. We get on the boat and it is now getting dark. I'm in a strange place in the middle of this huge lake on this boat not knowing where we are going. We arrive at dark, can not see anything. We ate dinner at 9pm! This is not acceptable, especially since we had no lunch! 
If it wasn't for our guide Huessein it would have been a horrible experience. Luckily he made it amazing for us. 
Last thing, when we left and stayed in Kigoma town, we were dropped at the hotel with NO information. Nothing about lunch, dinner or the museum tour. Food was terrible. The staff didn't understand what I was talking about. So I messaged Joshua with whom I had been speaking with, very little information again. I got ahold of the driver to ask him about the museum and he said Oh, we will go tomorrow before the airport. Again, he could not tell me how far the airport was and said he would pick us up at 8 for the tour to the museum. He then said the airport was 2 hours away. I told him we left at 1230. The next morning after our tour we realized the airport was 5 minutes from us! We spent 3 hrs at that little airport waiting. 
I just don't understand why the itinerary I received  was not followed nor was I ever given correct information. Mahale was such a special place and I would love to return. I'm not trying to be mean, I just want to inform anyone traveling here the situation.

Kristin,AU,Visited: April 2017,28-Aug-17,50-65,2-5 safaris,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,1,The bare minimum in both the company and the driver!!!!,Well emails were essentially good in the beginning we had conflicting prices attempting to recharge us for something we've already paid for. Having to walk two blocks at 11:30 p.m. with all our luggage in downtown Nairobi only to be left by the driver another 20 minutes to go get the car. On the way to the safari he drove very slowly to get to our destination on the way back he speeded 15 miles over. No communication between the operator and the driver didn't know our agenda argued about it with us didn't know about meal prep didn't know much nor did he point it out to us. It was horrible didn't have water had to remind him about it. He was more of a glorified cab driver than a guide. Choose someone else for Safari so you're not stressed out on your trip because of the owner and the driver.
Kristina,MT,Visited: August 2023,23-Aug-23,35-50,first safari,Seven Wonders Safaris,1,Ruined experience,"This was the worst trip ever in our ecperience and i apologise for the long write up but too much happened...So here it goes...
We booked 11 days shared Kenya and Tanzania safari with this company. The quotation was provided by and communication was held with Evelyn.
While said quotation was provided swiftly, we had to chase her to acknowledge/issue an official confirmation of the deposit payment, as according to her such are not typically provided (weird, isn't?). Since I insisted, some sort of confirmation was issued and she then disappeared without providing any details in terms of pick up or any other details. This silence continued up until the very last moment where although I requested information regarding the time of pick up (she didn't ask about our flights at any point before this), who shall be picking us up and where(it was our first trip to Nairobi, so we were not experts) by email to which no reply was received up until literally last day when I then messaged her again on whatsup (communication couldnt have been attached herewith unfortunately). So on this point a reply was sent and we communicated well upon arrival, where we were picked up by Evelyn at the terminal and 'handed over' to William who took us to their so called office which was closed so we were waiting for the driver outside(at this point we were saying how nice of her to meet us and William was great _he provided so much info on trips, acrivities, etc). Some half hr later the druver arrived and we thought we will proceed but no. We've been sitting and waiting for over 2 hrs and none carred to explain what's that we are waiting for since all 6 people were in the jeep. Here to our surprise although in all our agreed terms we were told that we will be up to 6 persons, 7th person joins instead of a guide! We the proceed to Masai Mara. Since we departed late, on the first day we only had 1.5hrs game drive close to our lodge despite itinerary indicated whole afternoon drive. 
The following day we had a full day in the park, but to our all disappointment we were then advised that the 3rd day game drives in Masai Mara will not happen as parks changed the rules ( instead of 24hr to 12hrs ticket validity). None of the 7 people on this trip had been informed of this ahead and none had been reimbursed for this either! we were not even given an option to purchase a new ticket ourselves (some 80 USD for the jeep would be nothing between 7 people when we already spent so much on the whole trip).Instead, the driver advertised a trip to Naivasha Lake as being great 1.5 hrs boat ride to observe birds with a stop on the island to feed animals. Since nothing else except for driving was to happen on that day (since 3rd day of Masai Mara game drives had been cancelled by the company) we decided to go and see the highly recommended lake (note that we didnt have internet so couldn't have checked ourselves and relied on the driver). To cut the story shorth we paid 30 USD each at the place in cash (only accepted in such manner) no tickets or receipts were issued. we spent 53 min exactly on that and saw a max  of 10 birds, the lake looked dead and none stoped us at any islands for any animals. Upon return to the shoar the driver bluntly asked if we saw hipos and crocodiles to which quite shockingly we replied that no such live there and he shouldn't have advertised something unless he knew what that really is! Perhaps a suggestion to the company at this point to send your drivers for such trips so they know exactly what is happening?! So even more disappointed we move to the hotel to yet again be shocked to hear that we will be left at some other place than the one we paid for (as specified in the itinerary)! Since this was stated when we were dropping of 2 guys at that place we took the opportunity to connect to the internet and check what's being offered to see that the place we booked showed eur 67 on booking.com while the one the driver told us to stay was 36 eur! We then refused to leave the jeep explaining that it's not our hotel and we want to go where we should! The driver following numerous calls with the office advised that the place we booked is fully booked so we must stay in this new cheaper place which all 5 of us yet again rejected. After some 45 min arguments the driver agreed to take us to the place we actually booked as we insisted that the place showed being available on booking.com and if anything, it must have been booked for us already. We arrive and...the place is nearly empty (why tell us its fully booked???) and we were also given options to change rooms! So lie no1 and we were not only disappointed regarding the  cancellation of 1 day of Masay Mara, lost time and money to see dead lake and even more time wasted on arguments regarding the accommodation that we paid for!
The last day in Kenya we went to lake Nakuru where we only had 2.5 hrs so yet again disappointed with the schedule as we should have had more time we proceed to Nairobi to be put on a public bus!!!!! For the transfer to Arusha. At no point in time were any of us informed that the transfer to Arusha will be through a public bus!!but surely it cost peanuts so more money to the company!

When in Arusha, the bus driver surprisingly dropped us at the hotel directly and we were informed regarding the pick up times for the following morning. So far so good.
In the morning the guy comes on time (impressive!) I told  him my name and the name of my fellow traveler, he checked his phone and put our bags in the jeep. Here we were informed that since we will be going to the bush, he will stop at the shops if we want to buy some wine and beer so he offerd to get it for us cheaper. We wondered how come he suggested we buy drinks ourselves when  drinks were listed in our itinerary as all included but we just let it go and went to withdraw some money to buy something. In the meantime he comes back stating that we should be going back as we are not his passengers! Why did I give him our names and what he checked remained mystery but here we are again wasting our time which we could have spent driving in the park. When he drives us to the office to exchange us, a guy there shows us a map and explains that we will be going to serengeti, ngorongoro and etc. I then specifically open my itinerary and read with him to confirm the details and accommodation which he confirms to me and to my fellow traveller. All good we proceed. In the evening, the driver announces that we shall be going to again diferent hotel than that indicated in the itinerary!!! Again no Internet and same explanation _ fully booked! We endup there where we didnt like to also then get to know during dinner that another 5 people ended up the same as us_we had to be at the hotel that the company stated was fully booked when it was showing yet again available and same story was now sold to 7 people! Although we had water, beverages and wine and beer included in our package, when we asked for water/wine during the dinner we were all told that we must pay for them.
The following morning I decided to write to Evelyn regarding all the above and ONLY asked her to ensure that the remaining part of the trip remains unchanged. She never replied but she asked the driver to pass his mobile to me and she started explaining that nothing changed, that the drinks had to be provided by our chef not the place itself (like we would have known who and what and why he didn't offer if he had to?)  that according to her when in the office, we were explained that the accommodation was changed and we never complained about anything etc. At this point I got seriously annoyed with her and their lies and I told her bluntly that i do not trust one single word she says as I told her in facts what happened and there were more people with me who heard all this. She then treated me  to cancel the safari as according to her I was lying, none of this what i was saying was true and that in their T&Cs there is indicated that they can cancel safari for whatever reason should they wish so. She told me that she will send the car to pick us up and bring us to the office where she will refund us for the safari to which again I explained to her that I didn't ask her for anything but just to stick to our itinerary and provide what we paid for! She insisted that this is impossible as I said that I don't trust her so consequently i cannot go on safari with their driver and she just cut the cinversation. We then spoak to the driver as he seemed lost  and she called again and again and from the treats to  cancel us she then decided to proceed with us and while on speaker she confirmed that we shall continue as per schedule and even herself named the places that we go and stay at. This as you can already imagine was another lie as on the way back from ngorongoro we were told that we are going to be taken to that same place where our argument started!! Here we refused to go again, another call another useless chat where she for the second time accused me of lying when the only lier was her and none else and we ended up in the situation  where I stated on speaker that her driver also heard her confirming that we will be going to the place that its written in the itinerary and he confirmed this to her in front of us! After some shouting and screaming by her at the driver we were told Nsya (the place we had in the itinerary) is not happening in any case and we were offered 2 other places.i insisted that if she wants to put us in diferent place again she must then upgrade us as we fed up having all these issues after paying for something that we are not getting! Guess what_ no point taken. Here we try to check on booking.com but the Internet was awful so we struggled. When asked the driver to check on his phone all of a sudden his Internet wasn't working and the only options were we were to go where he wanted to take us and we said no. He then took us to yet another diferent place to show it to us but we didn't like it and there was no Internet, he then took us to another place where the office stated that only 1 double room was available while we needed a twin  room and when arrived _ triple room was showed! Another lie! Here we were just sick and tired so we said fine we'll stay there but we want dinner and breakfast with all drinks as per itinerary. The hotel rep stated that this is not happening as the company only agreed to accommodate us on room only basis! Another half hr arguments and they decide to leave the company's chef to cook for us but we won't get hotel's food, and  also that we won't get any wine as that according to the driver we finished already while on safari! On this point when we were to proceed to serengeti the driver asked us if we like beer, wine or konjak and we told him that no strong alcohol is needed some like beer but mostly wine so we asked to get an extra bottle of wine (he had 1 box of beer in the jeep) and he came back with 2 bottles_ 1 red and 1 white (this for 6 people for 3 days). As said on day one we were not given any wine and the company said that the chef forgot to offer  but then they only got the wine the following morning so something doesn't click again! Anyone is still surprised?
So during the dinners on these next 3 days we only saw 1 bottle of white wine and some remaining little of white from the other jeep, while red wine disappeared. When we asked on the last night, the driver stated that he give 2 bottles to the lodge (which wasn't the case as we spoke to people who stayed there and they were paying for their drinks there, it would be weird that someone paying 200 eur a night would gake a bottle of cheap wine to tbe lodge "

The food was very cheap and disgusting and no drinking water in the camp. No hot water on the first day of the stay.

Kush,IN,Visited: August 2019,10-Nov-19,20-35,first safari,Tour Kenya Safari Heights,1,Cheats and liars! Do no trust! Do not book with them!,"My family and I recently travelled to Kenya and Tanzania to catch the Great Migration. Overall, the trip was fantastic; the wildlife and beauty of both countries was far superior to what one sees on TV!

However, we made a mistake by trusting local (Kenyan) travel agent ? Meshack Mutinda Kiilu from Tour Kenya Safari Heights, Nairobi. His agency booked the Kenya part of the tour for us while their partners, 7 Wonders Safari (Tanzania) booked the Tanzanian part.

The stark difference in both parts was surprising, especially given that positive word of mouth is important, and we expected much better service. Not only that, we never thought we would be blatantly lied to and misled.

Firstly, the car and guide we had in Kenya versus what we had in Tanzania were vastly different. The Kenyan car was in poor condition, the radio system didn¢®?t work (which is vital if you want your game drives to be successful), the windows didn¢®?t open, the car wasn¢®?t well maintained, the driver didn¢®?t speak good English and the car frequently broke down ? it basically didn¢®?t reverse without stalling.

Secondly, we were promised and had paid for a full day game drive followed by a morning game drive in Amboseli before departing to Nairobi. When we reached Amboseli, our guide informed us that he hadn¢®?t received the money for the morning drive. When we tried reaching Meshack he started dodging our calls and eventually became incommunicado ? forcing us to miss the morning drive. Not only that, we reached Nairobi and our driver told us that there was no dinner for us that day or meals the next day (although we had paid for all meals for all days as part of the package) and also that after dropping us off at the hotel in Nairobi (around late afternoon) we would need to pay him for taking us anywhere else since Meshack had not paid him for that.

While planning the itinerary, we had been promised a city tour and visit to a restaurant in Nairobi where guests can feed Giraffes. Our driver informed us that this wasn¢®?t part of the package as per instructions given to him; not only that, Meshack had not even paid him for our last day in Nairobi. The worst part was, we had earlier planned to depart Nairobi the same day we arrived from Amboseli but we spent extra for the hotel for an additional night in Nairobi because Meshack had said that there were planned activities in Nairobi as part of the package. 

Not only did we end up having to pay an additional $80 for the vehicle for two days, we had to spend additionally on meals for two days and also pay for airport drop off, which was supposed to be part of our package.

This was in stark contrast to our experience in Tanzania, where the driver, car and tour agency were excellent and gracious and even called us 
multiple times to ensure we were having a good time and that everything was going well.

Even the Kenyan driver told us that Meshack had lied to him and not paid him properly, and this was actually the first time he had worked with Meshack and it was going to be the last time.

Our excellent trip and opinion of Kenyan hospitality was marred by what were basically, outright lies and misrepresentations. When we got back and checked, we realized that there are few other reviews also where people have faced the exact same issue with Meshack and Tour Kenya Safari Heights. Anyone reading this review and planning to book through Meshack or Tour Kenya Safari Heights, do so at your own peril!"
kylie,BE,Visited: August 2015,08-Aug-15,20-35,2-5 safaris,Tanzania Safari Supremacy,1,not what was advertised,"Tanzania Safari Supremacy is a complete rip off. Simply put, what they advertise and what they set out in their itineraries are not what they will provide. I travelled with them in July 2015 and was utterly disappointed at the service they provided.

Firstly, when we were picked up from our hotel in the morning the operators demanded that we pay the balance in cash. This was never mentioned to us in any correspondence beforehand, which it clearly ought to have been given the size of our group and the amount of cash we would therefore need to have on hand. We had expected to be able to pay by card, but instead lost an hour that morning travelling to the airport to access an ATM ? a terrible start to the trip, a waste of our time, and no apology from the company. Unfortunately this was only the beginning of our problems.

We had opted to use this tour operator as they claim in all their materials that the drive to the park is 4-4.5 hours from Dar es Salaam (there are other parks in the region but they are a longer drive so we chose Mikumi as we had limited time available to us and wanted to maximise our time in the park). The drive took 6 hours. This wasn¢®?t due to traffic as there wasn¢®?t any significant traffic and the journey time was the same on the way back to Dar from the park. This delayed not only our arrival on the first day but also meant we would not have time to make use of our final morning on safari as we had to ensure we would make it back to Dar in time to catch the ferry.

The itinerary for the first day was to arrive by midday and immediately start on a game drive.  Instead, when we arrived the driver told us that the plan was not to go out on a drive until 4:30pm! This was a loss of over half a day of driving for absolutely no reason.

At this stage we were very annoyed by the situation. We asked the driver to take us out at 3pm so as not to lose so much time and, reluctantly, he agreed. We also asked at that stage for the driver to get the manager, Elvice, who we had corresponded with by email beforehand, on the phone so that we could discuss the issues that had arisen. The driver did not get him on the phone.

On the first evening the driver (allegedly) checked what time breakfast would be served at, told us it would be 6:30am and initially suggested picking us up at 7:30am to go on a drive. As anyone who has been on safari before will know, it is best to go out as early as possible as the animals move around most in the mornings before it gets too hot in the middle of the day. Thankfully, we knew this so insisted that the driver pick us up at 7am and he, again reluctantly, agreed.

Later that evening the catering staff (who are entirely separate to the safari company and did a fantastic job and were most helpful) told us that breakfast is not served until 7am (a fact I have no doubt the driver was fully aware of). They tried to contact the driver for us to tell him that we would instead go on a drive earlier and return for breakfast later in the morning but they were unable to get through to him.

The following morning the driver did not turn up until 7:25am. When we were eventually able to speak to Elvice much later that day he claimed that the driver was delayed as he had had a flat tire. The driver never mentioned this so I fully believe this was just a story concocted later on to try and cover himself. He didn¢®?t apologise at all when he did arrive late and when we made it clear that we were very unhappy with how we were being treated he again offered no apology.

As an aside, the driver showed very little in the way of knowledge about the animals. If we had not asked him questions about the animals I don¢®?t think he would have said a word the whole time and when he did answer questions it didn¢®?t seem like he knew very much about the animals. When we did come across animals it seemed very much like just a matter of chance rather than any skill exercised by the driver. Even if all the other issues had not arisen, I think we would have left the tour feeling quite disappointed by the drives because of this apparent lack of knowledge.

Returning to the main issues. When the driver arrived late that morning I insisted that he call Elvice as the group was so appalled at the service. He instead got another middle man, Philbert, on the phone who refused to listen to our complaints (which were expressed in a calm fashion) and began to scream down the phone at me, called me crazy a number of times, and then hung up the phone on.

We asked the driver again to get Elvice on the phone as he was, as far as we knew, the person in charge. The driver claimed that he did not know who Elvice was, he only knew Philbert. We told him that we were not happy to speak to Philbert and insisted he get Elvice on the phone and the driver said he would.

We eventually went out on our morning drive and by the time we returned for lunch we still had not received a call from Elvice (although we are quite confident that the driver was speaking on his phone to someone from the main office, he denied it when asked about it). At that point we again insisted on him calling Elvice. Again he claimed he did not know who that was and that he only knew Philbert so he put Philbert on the phone again, who claimed that Elvice could not be contacted as he was ¢®?in the bush¢®?. When I said that that wasn¢®?t acceptable and that we must speak to someone in charge he again started to shout at me and ultimately hung up the phone.

We again explained to the driver that we had to speak to someone in charge and that we wanted that phone call to happen now. 10-20minutes later we eventually got a call from Elvice. Unfortunately, all Elvice offered us were excuses, such as the phantom flat tire. He refused to acknowledge that the itinerary he had sent us was very different to what was proposed when we arrived and ultimately could offer us no solution. I asked that he consider the situation and call me back within an hour to offer some solution to the problem but, unsurprisingly at this stage, the call never came.

That evening when the driver dropped us off, we asked him to call Elvice again. At first he tried again to claim that he didn¢®?t know who that was or how to contact him, but, obviously, this didn¢®?t stand up and he eventually got him back on the phone. This time Elvice was much more hostile. He tried to claim that we had caused very issues and that we had tried to not pay for the safari (absolutely baseless claims), he offered the same nonsense excuses, and ultimately, when I insisted that there was no excuse for providing a service so different to what was advertised, he became completely frustrated and (judging by the sounds) hurled his phone against the wall.

Do not use Tanzania Safari Supremacy. There are so many companies offering safaris in this region, try any of them other than this one. They don¢®?t provide what they promise, their driver showed no expertise, and their customer service is despicable."

Day one and we have no tour bus and no communication. The day was shambolic with an alternative transport company organised by independents and eventually a 5 hour delayed arrival at our lodge. More alternative transport substituted on Day 2 in two run down vehicles. Third rate guides. Poor itineraries. And finally a broken down vehicle on the last day. Use this company at your peril.

But we had many problems with Orongai. When we arrived to arusha they changed the payment method, ALL the hotels and the itinerary without asking or inform us. The last day we spoke with the manager and he said that was unusual, but reading the reviews we think that they usually work in that way. We don¢®?t recommend work with orongai because you can¢®?t trust them if they are changing everything without inform you in advance and you can¢®?t do anything.

Larissa,DE,Visited: December 2018,31-Dec-18,20-35,first safari,Angose Travel Limited,1,"Don't do your Safari with Ibrahim, he screwed with us!!!","I was looking to do a 4 Day safari with a group. During my search I met a girl who was looking for the same thing. We both decided to do the safari with Angose Travel limited, because a friend referred her to this company with the Guide Jojo. We agreed with Ibrahim that Jojo will be our guide. When I met Ibrahim in the office, he seemed very friendly and answered all my questions. I asked about the camping situation and if people would share a tent. He told me that nobody has to share a tent with someone they don't know. 
On the day of the safari I was supposed to be picked up in town, I texted Jojo where I am waiting. Jojo responded that he is not coming, someone else is. Apparently he and Ibrahim had an argument, so Ibrahim decided to change the guide even though we specifically asked for Jojo. When I asked why, Ibrahim told me that Jojo is at a funeral. Jojo texted me at the same time that he is in town and told me to tell Ibrahim that we want him as a guide. The other girl also told me that Jojo was at the office in the morning, so clearly Ibrahim was lying to me.
I decided not to get upset about it and we started with the safari. After the first day in Tarangire we arrived in our camp and we all have been told that we have to share a tent with another person even though we did not know each other before the trip. We called Ibrahim and he only responded that it would be to much to bring a tent for everyone. Remind you, I specifically asked about this.
The safari goes on we saw many animals in the Serengeti and were about to cross over to Ngorongoro. Arriving in the Transit area we had to wait, because Ibrahim had not yet paid the entrance fee. After half an hour our guide came to us and told us that Ibrahim can't pay the fee as the banks are closed (it was Christmas) and asked us to pay 400$ so we could continue the tour. We were all shocked, as we have all paid for everything in advance and it should have been clear that banks are closed on Christmas. We were afraid that we would not get our money back and did not want to pay. We told Ibrahim that we need him to find a solution, as we could not use our credit cards. After almost 2 hours we called him as he still hasn't found a solution. We offered him that he could wire the money over via mobile money(these shops are always open) and we would use the credit card but he only had a bunch of excuses why he could not send over the money. We were even more convinced at this point that using our own cards would mean we would lose the money. After 3 hours Ibrahim told us that we just need to camp at the gate. Camping at the gate is not allowed and as we were stuck between serengeti and ngorongoro we had no where to go. So we had no chance than calling the police. We went inside the office of the gate and asked for the number. Luckily these guys wanted to see if they can help us. The park ranger from the office came to an agreement with our guide that we could go in and do our activities and before we leave ngorongoro crater conservation we have to come to head quarters to see if the fee has been paid by Ibrahim otherwise they would keep the safari car. The ranger also told us that we should not pay the fee, if we had already paid everything in advance, because the chance is high that we would not get the money back. Because of this we lost our whole afternoon and as it was about to get dark we had to rush to our camp which was 3 hours away. We drove so fast that we almost killed the animals on the road. We needed to set up our tents in the dark, were the last to eat dinner and got only very little sleep.
The next day we went to head quarters after our activities and there we still had to wait a lil while as Ibrahim had still not paid. Ibrahim had at this point no other option than paying the fees so he finally did and we could move on.
After my experience with the company I can only tell you do yourself a favor and go with a different company. We were not the only ones at this trip that got screwed over as another group we talked to had also a lot of trouble with Ibrahim."
Laura,KE,Visited: August 2018,30-Aug-18,35-50,first safari,Trip Advisor Africa Safaris,2,not recommendable,"Arrangements before starting the trip were managed well. The trip started with a delay of 2,5 hours. No explanations were provided, neither an information about the timing of the later departure. The accommodation in the tent lodge was not good at all: the mosquito net was not arranged, the bathroom was really dirty, food was acceptable, service personal rather rude. The bus we were transported in was not comfortable and noisy. The driver drove safely, was friendly and adapted to our wishes along the game drive. The game drive was nice as the wildlife we could observe was stunning."
Laura,AE,Visited: August 2017,20-Sep-17,35-50,first safari,Safari Mashariki Expeditions,1,Do not use this company!,"The jeep broke down and, even once 'fixed' (after we were forced to wait four hours!), the vehicle needed regular pitstops on the way back to our hotel for OIL(?!) top-ups in the steering fluid! Even our driver said the jeep was not fit for purpose. We were told that lunch and drinking water would be provided but they weren't- we had to pay for our own meal and that of our driver. We barely saw any animals at Saadani National Park. Our driver told us Alberto should have advised us of this at time of booking but he did not; he was only interested in taking our money. It's no wonder he has a string of failed businesses behind him. I have emailed him several times to resolve the problem but he has since ignored me and blocked me from his Facebook business page so I am unable to review and share my experience. Looking at the dates and the positive nature of the existing reviews on his Facebook page, I suspect he asked his friends to review him, as apposed to genuine customers. He is a con man!

Leah,AU,Visited: November 2016,21-Mar-17,35-50,2-5 safaris,Jewel Safaris,1,"Caution! Unsafe, unprofessional","Our (already beat up) safari vehicle broke down on the way which caused a 2.5 hour delay and a rush through the main site of Murchison Falls. The company didn't bother to send a new one so we had a 4.5 hour mechanics trip on the way home. We didn't feel safe (and the driver never turned the car off when we stopped because the mechanic told him not to). There were starter and wiring issues. This van had 365000 km on it - and the roads are rough.
The guide was lovely but the owner was untrustworthy and the way this was resolved was not satisfactory. Unprofessional, questionable safety. You'll get the same itinerary with better service elsewhere.
You can do better with another company - keep looking."
Leila,AU,Visited: January 2016,29-Feb-16,20-35,2-5 safaris,World Tours & Safaris Tanzania,1,Avoid at all costs this safari company if you do not want to be hassled by the owner Richard Papa,"We booked a 5 days and 4 nights safari Tarangire/Serengeti/Ngorongoro camping safari with World Tours & Safaris from Arusha to Mwanza. We needed to be picked up in Arusha and dropped off in Mwanza as we had plans to visit Lake Victoria. We contacted Richard Papa who was responsive but a bit short in his anwers. We didn¢®?t think of it as  it¢®?s so easy to misinterpret the tone of someone by email so we decided to go with the company. 

We were quoted for this private safari (as apparently no one wants to be dropped in Mwanza so it had to be a private one) my friend and I respectively $1000 and $920 (my husband was not traveling with us).  I am a resident in Dar es Salaam and Tanzanian national parks charge residents slighty less than tourists this is why I was offered a $80 discount on the whole amount providing I could prove my residency in the country.  If I failed to do so, Richard told me I would have to pay the difference at the gate which was fine with me since I had all documents in order. 

We paid for the full safari by bank transfers, twice, the first time for the 40% deposit and the second time the remaining 60%. Richard told us we could only pay the remaining of the sum in cash with US dollars if paid on the first day of the safari. Since I live in Dar with my husband, we do not have US dollars so we did the second bank transfer to avoid any hassle.  

The safari went well, we left the day after a night in Arusha Precious Inn, a very basic hotel but conveniently located a block behind the company¢®?s office. Stanley, our guide and Gadi our chef, were good and professional. They made the best with what they had, which wasn¢®?t so easy considering that the car was quite old and used (515 0000 km at the counter) and that their equipments were quite basic (for e.g after reading reviews on this website we decided to take our own sleeping bags). We enjoyed the 4 days trip even if the last day didn¢®?t go as planned. We were indeed meant to go through the Serengenti again but we did not and drove straight back to Mwanza after reaching the last Serengeti gate. Still, we were quite happy with the trip and gave each of them (Stanley and Gadi) a nice tip once at our hotel in Mwanza. As previously explained, before entering each park I had to give Stanley my passport and visa exemption certificate (residency permit) so he could go and pay the entrance fees. I always asked him whether he needed them and except for Ngorongoro crater where he told me he didn¢®?t have to show the documents. 

Once the safari finished, this is when the problems started with Richard. We were eating our lunch in Mwanza when Gadi the chef came back to us saying that we needed to pay more. When I asked him to explain why, he told me that I needed to speak to Richard. I took the phone and then Richard literally started yelling at me telling me that this was the deal I needed to pay $45 more for the Ngorongoro crater since I did not present my documents. He then told me that $45 was missing from his account (Stanley was apparently given pre-paid credit cards to pay the entrance fees) and that I should know where the money went. I told him that I was not one of his employees, that I did not know what happened with his credit cards and that so far only guides enter the park¢®?s office to pay entrance fees. I do not even know what¢®?s the entrance fee for each park since we always pick organised safaris. As a passenger you either stay in the car or go to the bathroom until the guide comes back and tells you to go back into the car. Richard said I did not present my documents so Stanley paid the fee for a tourist. I told him that when I asked Stanley before and he replied to me that for Ngorongoro there was no need for such document. As soon as I told this to Richard he started shouting ¢®?Then Stanley lied to me, pass me Stanley now I will take the money off his wages¢®?.¢®? and hung up on me. Now I have been living long enough in Tanzania to know that $45 is a lot of money for a local. Stanley also explained to me that the mistake was coming from Richard for another reason that I did not get. I felt bad and Richard kept texting me saying I needed to pay or Stanley would have to (which felt like emotional blackmail to be honest) ? I had done nothing wrong however unless I paid up then Stanley, who had been very professional the whole trip, would be forced to pay $45  - a lot of money for him. Stanley literally told me that if he had to pay the money the next safari he drove would essentially be done for free. Therefore I paid $45 on top of the $920 already paid not knowing whose mistake it was, Richard or Stanley. I thought that I could retrieve the money after speaking calmly to Richard since he was just shouting on the phone but I couldnt get a calm conversation out of him. 

When I spoke again to Richard and told him that it seemed quite unfair I had to pay an extra $45 for the Ngorongoro crater since I could prove my residency in the country (which I did for Tarengire and Serengeti) and that this would affect my review of this trip (I was quite annoyed by this point, I did not like him shouting at me or at his staff on the phone) he wrote me back an sms (I quote) ¢®? I will reply to your review as you wish to write and give all breakdown to the World since you said you have permit. GOD will judge. Thanks¢®?. 

Our following exchanges were quite a roller coaster of emotions from Richard since it seems my possible review of the company was really annoying him. He successively threatened me to expose that we were staying illegally in the country (we have been living in Dar for 7 months, my husband works for an European NGO), then told me (I quote) ¢®?I know you are a very good girl. You will not put us in trouble¢®? (I¢®?m 30 by the way), then wrote ¢®?I am not sure why you want even my family and other staff to miss daily bread¢®?¢®? (it¢®?s not like we do safaris in order to write bad reviews) and then also accused us not have done the right bank transfers (which was very silly since we have evidence of our bank transfers and knew they had gone through correctly) and that we had cheated him.

Additionally, Richard constantly blamed his employee Stanley when he realized I was having none of this and wrote (I quote) ¢®?Stanley is putting me and you in trouble¢®?¢®? One of Richard¢®?s email¢®?s object  is literally called ¢®?Stanley¢®? and is just a succession of accusations against poor Stanley. 
 
When I last told Richard I could not accept the refund coming from Stanley¢®?s salary (because to me it wasn¢®?t clear whether he or Stanley did the mistake and also because it will result on an unfair burden on Stanley) he told me I should have reminded Stanley of the residency (which I did but also I do not work for the safari company so that should not have been my responsibility). And then the last email coming from Richard states (I¢®?m just copying and pasting it because it is too good to be true) ¢®?I will attache the same letter and the permit and my lawyer will write a letter to your Embassy, with copy to Ministry of Natural Resource, and another copy to Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority to show them the way you want to mistreat us.They will judge who has problem between me and you. We made a deal and nothing went wrong to my agreement between me and you. All arrangements was in order¢®?. 

I told Richard he was a dishonest person who¢®?s been seemingly treated harshly his hardworking staff. Also, an important point, I did not understand his calculation as a resident I had to pay $920 and my friend (a tourist) $1000.Since according to Richard I did not show my documents in Ngorongoro I had to pay another $45 on top of the $920 which makes it $965. Stanley told me that if I did not have the paper as well in Serengeti I would have had to pay another $45. Which amounts to $1010. Which makes it $10 more than the fee for a tourist and this not even taking into account if I had to pay an extra for Tarengire. When I asked Richard to explain how I would have had to pay more than my friend despite getting a residency discount (which does exist for national parks) if I had to pay the difference at each gate, he did not bother answering. 

In a nutshell I¢®?m just baffled by the whole experience with Richard and his company World Tours & Safaris. Richard Papa strikes me as a very dishonest man and not a very professional one, not treating his staff nicely or even his customers.  I would strongly recommend any potential customer to stay away from this company and to go with another safari company because you do not want to experience what we experienced. Besides, there are a lot of other safari companies out there that do provide the same service and the same trip without the hassle we went through.

10 mph slower than everybody on the highway. We passed nobody, and got passed by semi trailers (really,) women walking with a 

hundred bananas on their head, and grazing goats. Very near Tarangire park, for no reason, we stopped in a small town for ten 

minutes, (to stretch our legs as driver said,) long enough to be pestered by peddlers. Approximately 30 other jeeps past 

through the town, and not one of them stopped. As we continued on, we found out the park was less than 10 minutes away. We 

stopped for 15 minutes to have boxed lunch, and started our safari at 1230. The driver who couldn¢®?t keep up to loaded trucks, 

is now racing thru the park like Al Unser. Most stops, he would start to drive away before we said we were ready to go. Ended 

the safari at 4:00 and were supposed to drive to the Serengeti park for dinner and lodging, but stopped In Mto Wa Mbu at 5 

even though dinner wasn¢®?t ready till 7:25. Total safari time on day one was 3 1/2 hours. Instead of staying at the Katikati 

tented camp, (which was absolutely amazing and one of the highlights of the trips,) we stayed in a 2 star hotel which charged 

$100 per night, as opposed to Katikati which is over $500 per night, so I wrote Seth the following letter. His reply followed

Seth I thought our safari was with Trip Advisor Africa Safaris, not Inno Africa Safaris??? Our itinerary is not how you 

emailed, or what it shows on your web page. There was no morning drive in the Tarangire yesterday. In fact we didn¢®?t start 

until 12:30, and left the park at 4, a mere 3 1/2 hours. So I thought, that¢®?s fine, we have to drive to the Serengeti, like 

your itinerary says. NO! We stopped at a lodge in Mto Wa Mbu at 4:55 pm, where dinner wasn¢®?t ready until 7:25, so we wasted 2 

1/2 hours doing nothing when we could be driving to the Serengeti. I thought, OK we will leave early so we can get to the
Serengeti for an early morning drive. All other safari companies staying here left this morning at 0630 or 0700. Not us. It¢®?s 

9:35 and they are still loading the Jeep. Obviously the morning drive (when the lions are out) at the Serengeti is not gonna 

happen as we won¢®?t get there until afternoon. Why did we just stay 17 hours in a lodge room without a tv, wifi or working AC? 

We paid for a safari, not to stare at four walls. Obviously we are not getting what was promised or what we paid for, and are 

not very happy. 

His response below, where h never answered any of our questions:

My dear to be honest, if you arrive at the lodge around 4:55pm, and the supper was ready at 7:25pm is there any problem? I 

think you were given time for refreshment before you go for supper, remember we are not at safari rally and if you start 

calculating time instead of watching the animal it will be a big loss to you.
Drive will try to go slow as he can so that you can see the animals, they will try to look areas where they will get animal, 

not as safari rally where they compete with time, our main aim is to see animals not to reach in time,
I will be very happy if you will tell me that you have see all the big five (5).
Thank for your understanding.

Day 2 we left late, because they made us wait for other customers to join us. We sat in that rundown hotel for 17 hours. We 

obviously lost the morning drive in the Serengeti. In fact, we never arrived till well after noon. We had only 3 hours on the 

safari. Day 3 we started an hour late because we had to wait for the driver to pick up the people staying at a different 

camp. Instead of a full day in the Serengeti like promised, we left early because the driver only purchased a 24 hour pass to 

the park, so we never got two days there like promised. Then we drove to our accommodations. Once again, we were taken to a 

different lodge then we agreed upon. We were supposed to stay at a beautiful lodge overlooking the crater. Of course, we were 

placed in lower valued and priced accommodations. I wrote both for prices. The difference was $200 cheaper for the place we 

actually stayed. Following is another conversation I had with Seth.

1. We were supposed to have two days in the Serengeti. We had only a 24 hour ticket

2. We were supposed to have two nights in Kati Kati tented camp. Instead we stayed in a rundown Twiga lodge without working 

AC. The price difference between the two was $400. The Kati tent was one of the highlights of the trip, Twiga was the 

lowlight. And we did not appreciate sitting in the Twiga lodge for 17 hours, instead of being on a safari

3. Last night we were supposed to stay at Sopa, overlooking the crater. Instead we stayed at Rhino Lodge. Price difference 

was almost $200 

Writing this to Trip Advisor Africa Safaris, his reply was this: 
Thank you very much for your update. First I like people like  you who do update us if something went wrong,and see how we 

can sort it out. To be honest, all the money you paid in Tanzania and even the $ 200 paid before I sent to our Tanzania 

counterpart for the same service. I have go through  your email and what your saying it is an acceptable, please allow me to 

contact my Tanzania counterpart and then I can come back to you latest Monday. People to serve a lot to come to holiday and 

they should get exactly what they have paid for, there is no way he can decide to take you to Rhino lodge instead of sopa 

lodge,to serve $200.Please am apologies for what has happened but before that, let me get the side of the story from Innocent 

then we can see what to do next.
Thanks again and again for your update!!

Seth Vincent

Conclusion: Day 1 we lost the morning drive at Tarangire Park, due to reasons listed above. Then we stayed in a poor hotel at 

Mto Wa Mbu city, instead of the stunning accommodations in the Serengeti.
Day 2, we stayed in Mto Wa Mbu for a total of 17 hours, waiting so they could join more people into our jeep. We obviously 

lost the morning drive at the Serengeti. As a result, we only had 24 hours there, not two days like promised. Day 3, started 

late again, and had to leave the Serengeti early before the 24 hour ticket expired. Then drove to our accommodations, which 

turned out again to be lower valued accommodations than promised. Day 4, were told we'd start at 7:00 am, got picked up at 

7:50. In all, we lost the morning drive at the Tarangire Park, one day at the Serengeti, an hour at the crater, one night 

stay in the Serengeti camp, and one night stay at the crater. The price difference between the accommodations day one was 

$400. The difference the third night was $200. That does not include the value of all the time we missed on the safari. I 

wrote Seth Vincent from Trip Advisor Africa Safaris and demanded a refund, for at least the price difference in the 

accommodations that they would have saved, roughly $600. Once again, that does not include all the safari time lost. After a 

month of back and forth emails, and me threatening to write an obvious bad review, it was apparent, that all he would refund  

us was $100 each, if we didn't write that review. Looking back at the pictures, and the memories, I am so mad at what we 

lost, and realizing they ruined our once in a lifetime trip, I am therefore now writing that review.

"Leszek, Marcin and family",PL,Visited: August 2019,19-Sep-19,35-50,first safari,Flash Safaris and Photography,1,Please do not make a mistake of booking your safari with Flash,"We recently came back from a safari with Flash. We couldn¢®?t have been more disappointed. Not only their cars are broken, they don¢®?t pay their drivers and they also tried denying obvious problems we experienced during our trip which we have video proof of.

The Car:

4wd drive didn¢®?t work. This caused us and other people to be put in a life-threatening situations when for example the car was sliding down a very steep hill, unable to go up without being pushed up by another car after our driver, Jerry, with help of drivers from other companies tried fixing it with a RUBBER BAND FROM THE ROOF-LOCKING MECHANISM. This wasn¢®?t the only case when someone had to push us. The gears didn¢®?t really work either. Going uphill, on an asphalt road with a speed limit of 80 km/h, their car could reach a maximum speed of 20 km/h, causing massive traffic jams behind us. Going down, we of course were able to reach 80 km/h easily. If that wasn¢®?t enough, the car¢®?s shock absorber broke down on the second day. We know that accidents happen, but during our trip it was mostly Flash cars that we saw broken on the side of the road. 

The Unpaid Driver:

On the last day after finishing the safari, our driver dropped us off at our hotel and we were getting ready for a well-deserved sleep. Half an hour later we were shocked to see him knocking at our doors in tears. It turned out that HE DID NOT GET PAID A SINGLE DOLLAR from Flash. That¢®?s disgusting! As he explained, all his money comes from tips. We omitted them, because Flash assured us that everything is already paid for and we were really irritated with our safari on the last day because of continuous problems with the car and Flash¢®?s inability to deliver a quality service.

The Lies:

¢®¡ÆNowadays at most part of our roads there is a speed limit of 50 km per hours and you must have seen all the police control posts. In the parks there is also a maximum speed limit and I want our guides to hold to this as we can lose our permit.¢®¡¾ - that¢®?s clearly not what we were talking about. We have video proof of car struggling at 20 km/h on a road with 80 km/h speed limit.

¢®¡ÆI asked Jerry about the starting problems, he told me that this did happen once and then some people had to push the car to get it started, there were no other incidents¢®¡¾ - It happened numerous times, with the most dangerous incident on a steep hill where another car had to push us. Not only we have a video proof of that, at that time in our car, there were also other Flash clients whose car broke down completely earlier that day.

¢®¡ÆJerry also told us that he never used a rubber to fix or repair the 4WD, you must have taken that wrong.¢®¡¾ - again, on that day we were accompanied by other people who have also seen it. Jerry clearly told us that he has a problem with activating 4WD and this rubber would hopefully temporarily solve the issue.

We asked: ¢®¡ÆPlease clarify for me how much was driver paid by your company. We want to understand how big is the tipping part of his total salary. Please confirm that our driver was paid by the company (what was the amount?) and that our tips were only the form of extra bonus for him.¢®¡¾ 
To which they replied that ¢®¡ÆJerry get paid a good salary¢®¡¾.
Well clearly if your driver comes up to our room after safari in tears something is wrong.

¢®¡ÆOn the way to the crater you indeed met with another car from Flash Safaris, it is very common that guides do help each other. Jerry stopped and you talked with the other clients. Then you asked Jerry to help and to take the clients with you. I really appreciate your gesture in this.¢®¡¾ - Just shows how ¢®¡Ægood with words¢®¡¾ Edward, the company¢®?s co-owner tried to be in his emails. Of course, we accepted the other people on board (for the whole day) because your car broke down completely and they were stuck in full sun for few hours with small kids in the middle of nowhere and you didn¢®?t manage to secure a replacement car!

SUMMARY:

4WD not working, problems with gears above 2, car not starting, broken shock-absorber, dishonest management unable to even admit the obvious problems, driver working for 0$ for 5 days in extreme conditions.

If you don¢®?t want this to happen to you, just choose another company. "
Liam and Jasmine,AU,Visited: July 2019,14-Sep-19,20-35,first safari,Kenya Walking Survivors Safaris Ltd,1,Fraudulent company stole our money and ruined our holiday.,"In March my partner and I paid for and booked a safari with KWSS for 21 days, over July and August. 
Things started okay, as we met an amazing driver named Sam, however things didn¢®?t run smoothly. 

Upon arrival we went to the KWSS office and a slight change was made. To save on driving times the owner (Otieno Lysaniash) recommended we would spend an extra night in the Masai Mara and not spend any time in Amboselli. It¢®?s also important to know that the accommodation that was being changed was a 4.5star camp to a 2 star camp. 

As we set off, Sam was keeping all his receipts and paying with his own money, and always on the phone away from us. When we questioned him he said ¢®?You shouldn¢®?t have to worry about this¢®?. After our 4 days with the driver, we exchanged numbers and were told a new driver would pick us, Sam was not sure what time, but said be ready at 6am. 

We have not heard anything from the KWSS office since meeting them in the office. We tried calling Otieno or his team over 100 times and sent emails to no avail. We were very lucky to have met Sam, as he was in contact with us from 9am, letting us know any updates as he found them. At approximately 7pm Sam was in Nairobi and confirmed with us the Mr Otieno had run away with our money, and the police were at the office. 

I feel horrible as it¢®?s very hard to get my money back whilst living in a different country. We are also aware that Sam paid for the first 5 days of our safari out of pocket, and he hasn¢®?t received any money back. We are in contact with Sam, trying to get updates, however he is a very busy man who has a family to feed. 

If you were looking for a different company we can recommend Bateluer Eagle Safari¢®?s, as they saved our holiday. Sam sent his brother to come and pick us up, who drove us around for 2 days to the police in Nairobi. The owners also went above and beyond, spending over 7 hours as we tried to get a payment sorted for a new safari, on last minute notice. Everything with them ran very smoothly and the upfront communication was very much needed, at a time where we had zero trust in anything. 

KWSS was run by a thief who stole our money and many others. I just hope he doesn¢®?t use that money to bribe the officials and get off without paying. We need our money back!"
Liam and Jessica March,UK,Visited: March 2020,13-Jun-20,20-35,2-5 safaris,Kenya Safari Bookings,1,words can barely describe!,"My experience of the masimara please read!!!

Day one consisted of the guide being 30 minutes late we were escorted into the mini bus after asking for a jeep as it was only me and my wife for the entire trip. We were asked for payment upfront that was ?770 the guy who took the cash made it very clear to me and my wife that this did not include a tip! After around 10 minutes the guy who took the cash left the minibus ( I¢®?m assuming to go back to the office) the guide and the ¢®¡Æcook¢®¡¾ Hardly spoke to me and my wife the majority of the journey.

When we got to the off-road road for the masimara we had seen many different animals like the zebra giraffe etc, we didn¢®?t get to stop to take a photo of these animals but instead had to wait until we had got to the masimara. On another part of the off-road there was another minibus that had got stuck so our driver Sammy and the ¢®¡Æcook¢®¡¾ got out the car and abandoned me and my wife with the the vehicle. At this point we were then surrounded by the locals (children and adults ) it took around 20 minutes for our guide to return, we then continued with our trip

We finally reached the masimara and had gone on our first game drive for 2 hours.  our drive consisted of what looked like Sammy catching up with his colleagues. And towing more people out of the mud. We saw an elephant which he did not stop so we could take photos! This was a very bad first game drive. 

Day two of the masimara. We had woken up early to get a start in our long day of game drive, at first I was very disappointed in the lack of water available to me and my wife after all this was included in that ?770 price.   We drove around for a while taking photos of animals it was very hard to get a photo as Sammy wouldn¢®?t stop moving the bus but just drove slowly. We had to ask him a few times to stop the vehicle before he finally got it! During our drive Sammy decided to go off road in the masimara ( this is not allowed) to see cheetah cubs. We just about got to where they were hiding before we turned around and returned to the road. This was because the KWS had spotted Sammy going off road. Sammy and a few other guides got out of the vehicles and spoke to the KWS (Kenya wildlife services) my wife took a photo of Sammy bribing the KWS (we thought he was paying a fine).  when Sammy finally arrived back in the car we asked him what was going on. He told us he had to pay $30 to see the cheetah cubs as off roading is not allowed, this is around 3000 ksh just over. We then proceeded to drive to the cubs though I had asked Sammy not to and just let the cubs be. And I must admit when we got to the cheetah cubs they were beautiful we took a photo but felt terrible doing so. Not to mention they were not good photos because Sammy would not keep the vehicle still. We proceeded on with our drive and it was finally lunch time. We were starving! So my wife is vegan and when arranging the tour online my wife had told the office she was vegan in multiple occasions and when my wife told the cook she was vegan he was shocked after finding out what a vegan was, and asked if she ate chicken. That part is not important but it was funny.  Anyway more to the point. We hadn¢®?t eaten much before lunch and when we sat down to have our picnic she unwrapped her sandwich to find she had butter on her bread! It was a good job a monkey stole that sandwich because this was just another example of how unorganised this company really was!

Day 3 this was our final game drive after telling Sammy a few times we did not want to see the masih villages, we headed out! We took the same route as the day before and the day before that but it was a good job we went the same way again as we saw a family of lions! This was probably the best part of our trip. We stayed there for a while before everyone else started swarming in and then we left. On the way back to the gate one of the other drivers had asked Sammy if we can take some one past the gate on the way out. Now bare in mind me and my wife paid for a private tour this was that ?770 I mentioned.  Sammy had agreed to this and we would stop and talk to this lady and even drive past animals we wanted to photograph the drive back to the gate took around an hour.

Sammy treated our tour as he would a group tour.  We would watch animals for as long as he deemed necessary he was on his phone for most of the safari either talking or texting and on a few occasions even in social media (Facebook) a few times me and my wife heard him make jokes to his colleagues about the coronavirus ( covid19 ) this wasn¢®?t funny! And I was very annoyed by this! 

I would rate this safari tour with 2 stars as from start to finish as we were greeted with just pure unprofessionalism. This tour was unprofessional disrespectful to the animals and unethical. 

I ask anyone that is thinking of going with this safari tour company to please rethink! I regret my decision booking with this company! "
Lily,AE,Visited: August 2014,24-Sep-14,35-50,first safari,Kairi Tours & Safaris,2,not well-organized and put me into cheaper hotel than what was quoted in the itinerary,"I did a two-week Kenya and Tanzania safari with Kairi Tours in late Sept 2014. (My agent tour is Java Africa Safaris Ltd, but then I found out everything was arranged through Kairi Tours & Safaris Ltd. ) There were some dramas that never happened during my other international trips. When my flight arrived in Samburu, there was no driver to pick me up. The Safari Link pilot had to stay with me for more than one hour in a hot stuffy plane in a dry and windy desert-like wilderness. He was so kind not to leave me along since there were animals all around the air strip. The driver finally turned up after the pilot had to fly away and leave me with a local gun-carrying soldier. It was such a horrible wait under the sun, sweating with dust on my face. Then when I arrived in Tanzania, their tour agent in Tanzania put me into a much cheaper and much lower quality camp site instead of the lodge I booked in my itinerary. They also tried to change my activities to suit their profit without following"
Lily,CR,Visited: December 2016,21-Jan-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,African Breeze Tours,2,"If you want a budget safari, this is definitely a budget safari.","Tour itinerary looked great and Cate was very friendly, but she neglected to tell us that the total payment for the tour was due on Day 1. This resulted in some scrambling to withdraw cash from an ATM but we were limited by ATM withdrawal limits. There was no option to pay online with paypal or with credit card! Finally at the end of the tour Cate had told or driver a different amount than what I truly owed (a $10 USD difference) and also told the driver that was should pay him extra for dropping us off where we were staying in Nairobi even though this was included on the itinerary (in addition to a regular tip).

Our itinerary told us to be picked up at George's Cafe at noon, by 12:30 we were still waiting and called Cate. Cate had apparently (forgotten?!) to call a driver and our driver finally showed up at 2:00pm with no clue about what our itinerary was. To his credit, he was able to take one look at our itinerary and then figure out what hotels he wanted to take us to. There were a lot of extra costs that were not described in the itinerary unfortunately. I ultimately didn't mind paying, but if a boat ride was listed on the itinerary I would have appreciated knowing that it would cost me $100 in cash. While the extra expenses were no big deal, a heads up would have been nice, unexpected expenses can be frustrating. 

Our tour driver, Johnny, was friendly but apparently lies to KWS to try and get resident rates for non-residents (this was from a story he told us making fun of the stupid white people who ""forgot"" they were supposed to be going by fake names). This was disheartening to hear about because this is a big loss of money to wildlife conservation. I'm a resident and my traveling partner was not and luckily Johnny did not try to lie to get resident rates for her. It was a slightly odd interaction. 

The hotels we stayed in were clean with excellent food but no hot water in any of them unfortunately. Johnny seemed to have a poor understanding of when meal times should be and how often people need to eat because lunch was at 4pm on Day 2 (he seemed to think we could skip it?!). He also tried to skip lunch on another day right before a long hike (who skips lunch before a long hike?!). He often told us dinner couldn't be ordered before 7:30 (resulting in multiple meals at 8:30 PM!) but the kitchens seemed to be open and working as early as 6 because there was always waitstaff ready to take our order when we arrived. He also often ate with us, which I normally wouldn't mind, but he would order too much food for us (even when we told him we couldn't eat that much) and then guilt us with cultural values if we didn't clean our plates. He subsequently also couldn't clean his plate, but would then offer up some excuse about the food being bad. Overall a bit odd. 

Johnny was also getting a bit old and in failing health (coughing and wheezing which made us a bit uncomfortable) and it was clear by his driving sometimes that his eyesight is no longer the greatest. There were a few speed bumps he missed slowing down for and game driving in parks is not his forte! I spotted the rhinos and lions we saw and he stopped at a buffalo once thinking it was a rhino.  He also bragged that he would find us a leopard but never did. (I've seen leopards before but the boasting was strange). In general our driver was friendly, but nothing like the kind of service I've had on other budget safaris. 

We stopped at multiple curio shops and they are usually expensive, but I've never had someone try to sell me a shuka (usually cost 600ksh and never worth more than 700ksh) for 4,000ksh. I was surprised that knowing that I'm a Kenyan resident Johnny would still try and take us to a place this ridiculously expensive. After they tried to scam us once Johnny actually took us there a second time. (???). He also added in a random stop at a girl scout memorial for people that I know nothing about and the man there asked for donations of any size so I at least thought offer 100ksh but he then turned around and said that wasn't enough. Was getting a bit sick of Johnny taking us to people who were just going to ask us for too much money. Especially since we told him that were not interesting in gift shopping as we were planning on doing that in Nairobi.

The itinerary was great, but at the end of the trip I wouldn't recommend trying to cram as much as we did into one week. Spend at least two nights at every location so that you get a full day at each. Cate added a few extra things to my itinerary beyond what I requested and I trusted her to know what would make a good trip but now I wish I'd asked to cut some of those extra locations. 

Good thingsBecause it was budget we ate a lot of ugali and nyama choma which I love. Food was always delicious. Parks themselves were beautiful and wonderful. 

TL;DRThe organization and communication was poor. Driver friendly but not very skilled and in bad health/bad eyesight. Would not recommend. You can find better budget safaris than this, or just rent a car and do it yourself. "
Linda,US,Visited: June 2023,21-Jul-23,35-50,first safari,Glorious Tanzania Tours,1,BEWARE- Did not refund whole deposit for TZ after referring us to a tour operator in Kenya who scamm,"Beware of the company and proceed with caution if you need help with major issues. I reached out to Glory around May of 2022 to start planning my trip. The trip was revolved around getting a stay at the Giraffe Manor.

She referred me to her partner in Kenya who she raved about. Lucy with Splendor Holidays, she seemed very responsive and provided a decent itinerary, price and promised she got the room for June 5, 2023. Glory planned her side, and I paid both deposits. There were three people going and I paid $10,477 for Kenya and $2850 for TZ USD.

Everything seemed fine and we kept in touch here and there and as the date inched closer, Lucy claimed in March that her sister passed.  By the end of April I started chatting more frequently.  On May 2, we were trying to fill out the visa when the website on Splendor Holidays was down. We found out that Lucy wasn¢®?t being responsive or making up excuses.  Glory went up to Kenya to have Lucy arrested and she documented everything. Glory provided a police number and the court documents, which was a little off. People on social media and a journalist had pointed out the number wasn¢®?t right, but I gave the benefit of the doubt that there was no way Glory was involved.

Glory said she felt so terrible and that she wasn¢®?t attentive to our tour. She said she had personal reasons and that she let us converse directly with Lucy.  Normally, she would arrange things with Lucy (Splendor Holidays) and take the money. I asked her multiple times, why did she change protocol on us, and this happened?

Glory tried to suggest another tour guide to do driving and to pay nearly another $1000.  When I reached out to the company, their website was down as well for ¢®¡Æreconstruction.¢®¡¾  Glory promised she was going to come meet us when we landed in Kenya and she didn¢®?t.  Glory did not reach out to us at any point during our Kenya trip, she was silent. We received help from strangers in Kenya.

Due to the complete change in itinerary, my friend and I had originally booked to fly from two different airports in TZ. There was no way to make it work and be able to fly home with a reasonable price. When I reached out to Glory, she only gave us 50% of the deposit back. When I asked why, she said last minute cancellations are very difficult. I asked her to provide the cancellation invoice to submit for my travel insurance or something. She then stated that she doesn¢®?t have them, and it is very exhausting to get the evidence I need. 

I told her if I can reach out to the hotels, I think anyone knowing I got scammed would make an exception. She said that her reputation is already ruined, and she will not give me access to the hotels and ruin it by reaching out to them. She also claimed that she respects the hotel¢®?s time and policy. I got upset and said so you don¢®?t respect me and the money I¢®?ve lost.  How I spent my dream vacation going to the police, embassy, and running around trying to get my money back from her ¢®¡Æwonderful Kenyan partner.¢®¡¾ Glory claims she had no idea that Lucy could do this and that she did what she could. She kept saying no one else would do this for me when she caught Lucy.

I finally called Glory out on the fact that she never checked in on me in Kenya and broke her promise of being there. She stated she was following me on social media and gave me space to deal with the embassy and that they would help.  She said she had stuff back in TZ to manage and she lost money. I told her it costs $0 to check in. 

I had been warned before that there was a chance Glory could be involved and I gave a benefit of a doubt because she was friends for so long with my best friend in the States. There is a chance she has nothing to do with it, but the way she handled it has been terrible and she will not give you back money. She said she¢®?ll make me whole, but in November. It is very odd that she will pay out of her own pocket versus trying to reach out to the hotels to get the deposit back. There is another person on tripadvisor that left very similar feedback about her lack of help.  She had mentioned this, and I thought she only had one bad review, but I do believe the validity at this point.

I can give the benefit of the doubt that she had no idea all these tour operators weren¢®?t scammers as she claimed, but the way she responded was unacceptable and because I had questioned Pesapal, the payment platform why Glory required all my banking account including my SWIFT to give my deposit back, she blamed me for the delay.  She sent emails calling me a liar, etc¢®?gaslighting me.

After several email contact we succeed to let them know we will drive by ourself inside the gate to the camp. That was no problem they said. Arriving at the gate we had to pay to enter the gate again (R560) The gate fee was in the package we booked, so we already paid for it. Arriving at the camp, nobody knows about us. There was no reservation. Tried to chat with Krugerpark.com, nobody responded. Then we call them, I couldn't understand a word they where saying because of the bad connection. They called me back and gave a reservation number. (The calles costed me R300) Back to the reception, nothing to find again even with the reservation number. Asked the reception if they can contact Krugerpark.com for us. Finally the found something. Krugerpark.com called the driver and he picked us up finally, already to late for our first game drive. Back in  Holland again I started contact Krugerpark.com to get our money back for the gate fee and my telephone costs. Pff not funny anymore, I think I had to explain 10x what happened to the same lady. 3 months later (february), sending several reminder emails I finally got an email that they will refund my money. No it is june and I still haven't received any money. "
Lindsay W,US,Visited: July 2022,09-Aug-22,35-50,over 5 safaris,Unlimited Tours & Safaris,2,Sadly Disappointed.,"I¢®?ve been on mobile safari before, many times. This is the first time I¢®?ve ever had so much anxiety on a safari and been so disappointed. 

We paid for 6 nights safari, 2 nights hotel in Maun, 3 hour Mokoro ride and transport to and from the airport. We paid 7 months in advance. 

3 days before leaving, we reminded them of our arrival. They asked us who was picking us up and where we were staying. That was their job. We sent them the invoice they sent to us where this was covered and they said they had it under control. 

The day we were supposed to leave, our flights were cancelled (not their fault) but I tried to call and let them know of the updated flight. All calls went unanswered. They finally responded to an email saying they got the updated information and we wouldn¢®?t get our money back for the hotel on arrival night (fine, last minute change) but that the hotel wasn¢®?t available for the final night either because of ¢®¡Ærenovations¢®¡¾ which was odd, the last night was never impacted. Why was it suddenly unavailable? I think it¢®?s because they completely forgot. 

We start our safari and the car is unreliable. I¢®?m not talking old, refurbished or dusty. The car wouldn¢®?t start half the time, there would be smoke coming out from under the hood, burning smells, random wheels stopped turning mid-drive and the passenger door would randomly open mid-ride. The guide was constantly having to put in motor oil, jump the car, be under the hood and working on the tires to get them moving again. He even had go tie the passenger door so it would stop opening while we were moving. 

The guide had zero knowledge of our Mokoro ride and where we were staying in Maun. He called numerous times at each gate we passed - calls went unanswered for days. He even went to the gates while we took an afternoon naps to try to resolve everything but said no one answered or no one called him back. The Mokoro ride eventually happened, but only because we armed the guide with proof we paid for it. 

The guide also said he¢®?s worked for many mobile safaris. They usually give a print out with all the details but he didn¢®?t get one for us. He said he was called 2 days before (conveniently around the time we reminded them of the safari) and everything was instructed over the phone. 

The crew was fine, the food was good though we ate cold cuts everyday for lunch, and the guide showed us all we came to see but it felt like our safari was completely forgotten by Unlimited, then slapped together last minute. If we hadn¢®?t reminded them, I bet we would have been stranded at the airport. How can you pay a company thousands of dollars and have to remind them you paid for a safari? 

When I thought it was all over and we just go to the airport now, Unlimited had one last surprise. They didn¢®?t pick us up from the hotel to the airport. They didn¢®?t bother to tell us there was a problem with the car until we called, and they weren¢®?t going to pick us up until 1 hour before the flight - leaving us no time to get through passport control, baggage, security and board. The hotel called a taxi. Thankfully we did, we arrived with only 5 minutes to spare before boarding. 

When I got home, I saw they had taken a high profile client out based on their social media posts, so I guess that took priority over us. It was upsetting considering we saved up for 2 years for a mother-daughter safari and we should have just gone with someone else we knew and trusted. "
Linn,IE,Visited: August 2013,13-Apr-17,35-50,over 5 safaris,Sandland Tours and Safaris,1,Worst safari agent ever!,"This is the most unprofessional and worst agent we've dealt with ever!

We booked our safari through a company in Kenya but for the Tanzanian part we were outsourced to Sandland Tour, Arusha.  

We and also an other girl in our group (who had booked with different agent in Kenya) had to all the time argue and pin point what was included in our intiniary.  If we haven't had the out print to show them they would have over ruled us on everything and cut things off.  Exin our intinary we were supposed to drive to Serengeti via Olduvai Gorge.  We drove right passed it.  We were even supposed to have our lunch there, whitch did not happen.
First day 2 individually travelling guys joined us, both of them with different intinary.  Second day they were sent to a different group.  They were supposed to leave 30 min before us but they were there still waiting when we left.
First night at camp my husband and I got a tent together as we were a couple but the girl and the two guys , who all traveleld indvidually and didn't know each other, were placed in the same tent.  The girl of course argued and after hard discussion the girl got a tent for her self.  But the guys still had to share.

As they also changed the order of the itiniary we were short cut on things.  
Also they took us to Tarangire park, whitch we did not have in our itiniary.  This led to that we had far less time in Serengeti than what our plan said and we payed for.

 They also skipped breakfast one day.  When they wanted to do so second day we told the guide and the chef that we won't have it.  So they ahd to give us breakfast anyway.  But of course resulting in less time game driving as they didn't start the day earlier like we requested to not to miss out on time of game drives.  We saw other groups start earlier with breakfasts so they could get sunrise in the parks.  

Our guide, George, was not competent and showed very little interest in making a good safari for us.  He knew less about animals/trees/plants/birds than we did.  Many questions he didn't even answer. We did not enjoy the atmosphere on the safari and didn't feel comfortable at all.  In the end we were just happy to be finished with the safari in Tanzania and hoped we would arrive safetly back to Kenya as we felt we could not trust them at all.  

When the safari was over and we were supposed to get transport back to Arusha as the other girl had one more day with safari.  George, the guide just left both us and the girl with no words.  Him and 2 others drove off, and we never saw them again.  The girl was supposed to have an afternoon game drive but at 5pm she was still at the camp.
We sat there with a stranger who spoke barely english as our driver and with  no information and we were waiting for almost 2 hours before we left for Arusha.  2 hours we could have spent more on game drive or been in Arusha for sight seeing. 

The day we were supposed to get bak to Nairobi we were supposed to have breakfast at 7am as our transport was to leave at 7.30 from the hotel.  We were in the restaurant at 6.55am, they didn't give us the food before 7.25 even the chef and 2 waitress's were there fromt he moment we came.  We tried to tell them several times that we have to leave at 7.30 but to no help.

The day we arrived in Arusha from Nairobi the boss, Abraham wouldn't give us dinner as they said it was not included.  After showing them the intiniary and discussing and making us wait 3 hours they said we could have dinner.  

It was very unprofessional and very unfriendly customer service. If we knew what we knew to day we would have skipped Tanzania all together as it actually led to no pleasant part of our holiday than what it did good.  Unfortunately waste of money.  Make sure when you book safari that it's the same agent handling your safari all the journey."
Lisa,US,Visited: December 2016,09-Mar-17,50-65,2-5 safaris,Katona Tours & Travel,2,Less than expected for a custom tour,"Communications with the agency were prompt and polite and included the attractions I wanted to see but I paid for a custom tour (I was the only client), expecting a great guide to tell me all about the land, flora, fauna and people along the way of my 5 day trip.    My ""guide"" was a driver, not a guide and on long stretches of driving (some up to 8-9 hours), he did not engage me unless I kept asking specific questions.   They didn't have wildlife or bird guide books in my vehicle to help me make sense of what I was seeing.   I also had issues with the rude guide they  handed me off to in Bwindi to see the Batwa people, who tried to steer me to a Bachiga village instead of the Batwa one that I had specifically asked to go to.

The attractions themselves did not disappoint Kibale for Chimpanzee tracking was great--I was dropped off at the park and a ranger took over from there.  The Kazinga Channel boat tour was superb, the experience in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest for gorilla trekking with their rangers was an incredible.

 In all fairness I contacted Jackie at the main office and let her know my concerns and she was very apologetic, so I assume she has fixed the problem(s).  Perhaps if it had been a group, I wouldn't have these issues, but as a solo traveller, I felt I had paid a lot for a lesser level of service."
Lisa,AU,Visited: February 2022,11-Feb-22,35-50,2-5 safaris,Adventure Dragon Safaris,1,Francis Otieno is a SCAMMER!,"Francis Otieno is a seasoned scam artist operating as a tour operator 'Adventure Dragon Safaris'. Under the suggestion of the safari driver (who was working for this scammer for the first time thus didn't know him), I have filed a police report and he has been issued with an OB number.

I could go into a lot of detail, but in short, he actually pretends to work for a registered company called Big Safari Tours and he didn't fully honor the tour I paid him for. On day 2 of the safari, the driver said he had not been sent the park fees and because we were such a long way, we had to pay for these (again) and hope he would refund us the money later. Of course, he turned his phone off. Back in Nairobi, the guide managed to get a hold of him, but he refused to refund the money so effectively, he had stolen those park fees even though it was part of our agreed safari tour. That, along with impersonating a registered company, is what is in the police report.

Foolishly, I did not verify that he worked for Big Time Safari until after I paid him the deposit in his MPesa account, in which he issued me with a receipt from his 'sister' company 'Adventure Dragon Safaris' with an official-looking logo. I couldn't verify with KATO that his 'business' is registered. While I wondered whether he was going to turn up at all and run off with my deposit, he did turn up, so I thought I was simply going to get what I paid for but with another company. I was obviously wrong. He is very manipulative, but the lies started becoming?obvious when he?suggested additional activities at clearly inflated prices (he quoted $150 for an activity I already knew was $60). I also discovered that he overcharged me for the actual tour too.

I acknowledge that all this wouldn't have happened if I had done my due diligence and had not been so trusting, but as it has happened now, all I can do is warn others not to make the same mistake as I did. I feel rather stupid because normally, I verify these things on Trip Advisor and such. I'm not the first person he has scammed, but I do hope I'm the last. Given he hasn't even changed his phone number or Facebook for several years, I feel it has been too long that he has been getting away with it. He told me he recently bought a new car (he's also an Uber driver). It's probably no wonder with all the money he continues to steal from people.?"
Lisa,US,Visited: March 2020,01-Apr-20,50-65,first safari,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Robert was responsive and staff friendly but.............  NOT an overall great experience - Sadly,"Robert was very responsive.  In fact, I contacted a few companies and thought that I was working with Robert for a couple of weeks to find out that it was another company.  A couple of days before I thought I was going on Safari, I found out from the other company that it wasn't Karibu and didn't think I would have a chance to go on a safari last minute.  I called Robert and he said he needed to call me back to see if it was still possible.  I was then confirmed for a 7 day safari that was to start in Masai Mara and then go to Amboseli as the last park.  He also said that I could pay in Shillings since I did not have USD. (I was on a working visa and had been in the country for 3 months, so only had Shillings)

I was greeted a few days later by a driver who was picking me and taking me to the office to start my safari.  I didn't think any of it.  Got to the office and signed my paperwork and paid.  Was brought downstairs and put in the same low rider vehicle that the driver picked me up in.  I just thought the driver was taking me to the place were the Open top Vans or jeeps were going to be.  After the driver started to drive out of town, I questioned him on the vehicle and he said no that it was just me and him and in the car.  He then said, instead of going to Masai Mara, we were going to go to Amboseli first and go backward because the car can't be driven in Masai Mara.  I told him that I was not happy and didn't think this was going to work.  He said that even with a car, It wouldn't be an issue getting great pictures in Amboseli.  After trying to contact the office and not getting through, I felt I had no choice and agreed.  SADLY, not true.  

Don't get me wrong, the driver was a GREAT guy...... and due to CoronoVirus and the country shutting the borders and airports down, I had to leave after the first full day.  Karibu did give me a partial refund (only for 4 days of park fees - about 200) but I was hoping for more due to the fact that I was in a car that was so low, the undercarriage of the car came off and we couldn't go that far into the park because it would flood out or scrap. Plus trying to take pictures so low in this car with tinted windows was a nightmare.  I only got one day and it really didn't give me the happy experience I was looking for.  When I got home aside from the photos on the hilltop from lunch, they were not great!!!! Not from my cell phone or borrowed camera.

I took pictures of the car but it doesn't allow me to add them onto this review sadly.  You will see what a disaster of a car it was for a safari.

Like I said Robert was nice and replied back quickly and Raymond the driver in the car was nice and felt bad.  The staff at the tented camp was great too..... 

If it wasn't for the LOW RIDER CAR, and the fact that they didn't refund me in full the money for the other 5 days, I think this company might have been fine which is the reason why I gave them 2 stars.  I feel bad for rating so low but it just wasn't practical putting someone so low in a car with dirty tinted windows for a safari after they confirm via email that the vehicle was an open-top Van. I honestly would have rather not even gone and saved myself a lot of money. "

Hello

Here is my feedback following a trip with the local agency Epic Uganda Vacation as well as my feedback on the lodges and my itinerary.

Every year, I travel with my dad. Not living in the same country, we meet somewhere in the world for an average vacation of 8-12 days.

This year, we chose Uganda, from February 14 to 23.

I chose Epic Uganda Vacation and talked with them to put together an itinerary that met our expectations.

3 weeks after paying for half of the trip, the agency told me that 3 of the lodges I had selected were finally fully booked. At the time, although disappointed, I found new lodges that we liked and was able to confirm these with the agency. After having been able to check the tourist influx in Uganda, I doubt today that no lodge was really full. First disappointment.

Having to work every day for about an hour, I asked the agency for confirmation several times that internet access would be possible on our itinerary. They assured me that was the case. And¢®? that was not the case at all. The lodges generally have a router at the restaurant but these only work very slightly. I bought a sim card with internet data, but without 4G (or very little) during our itinerary, it was not useful.
The agency also told me that they had internet at all times in the vehicle. The router had an autonomy of about 30 minutes in the car and had to be recharged on mains plug after that (thus completely useless during road transfers of several hours).
If the agency had been honest with me, I could have managed not to work during this period, but that was not the case. Second disappointment.

Moses, our guide, supposed to be fluent in English but we had a hard time understanding him. Third disappointment.

My father arrived in Entebbe on February 14th in the early afternoon and I in the late evening.
Our departures were scheduled as such: my father had to leave at 3 pm on February 23th (and be at the airport by 1 pm at the latest) and my flight was leaving at 11pm on February 23th (so I had to be at the airport by 9pm).

ENTEBBE
We spent the first night after arriving at the Airport GuestHouse hotel.
Very well located (close to the airport), quiet, spacious and very pretty rooms. The service is pleasant and the food ok.

MURCHISON
The next morning we drove to Murchison with a stop at the Ziwa Rhino Sanctuary. The walk is pleasant and the park well maintained. The proximity to the rhinos is original, impressive and is a very good experience.

Arriving in Murchison, we settled in at the Twiga Safari Lodge.
The rooms are spacious, clean and the view right at the foot of the Nile is splendid. The service is very good, the food excellent.

The next day's program was to take us to the base of Murchison Falls, by boat cruise and then up the falls to see them from above.
We finally stopped more than a kilometer from the falls for a short minute, after 2 hours of boating and returned to the starting point.
Explaining this disappointment to our guide, he finally took us to the top of the falls.

The Nile is breathtaking, powerful, the view is magnificent. This place is not to be missed under any circumstances.

KIBALE

Depart for Kibale with a stop at 'Amabere Ga Nyinamwiru. A stop with a visit to the caves and the wonderful waterfall.

Arrived at Kibale, we settle in at Turaco Treetops. Spacious, magnificent rooms, in the middle of the forest, with a breathtaking view. Very good service, good food.

The next morning, we leave for the chimpanzees trekking. An experience to live absolutely, which is indescribable. We were lucky enough to be able to find the family very quickly, and to observe them on the ground, in the trees, eating, playing, preening, ¢®?

Following this magnificent experience, we did the Bigodi Wetland nature walk, which I also recommend. The different village houses, the tasting of banana beer or banana gin, and the walk in the swamp allow us to discover this ecosite which is absolutely splendid.

QUEEN ELIZABETH NATIONAL PARK
Transfer to Queen Elizabeth for a day of game drive and installation at Pumba Safari Cottages. A hotel well below the range we had paid for. A new disappointment. The view is beautiful, the bed comfortable, but the room is tiny. The service is very bad and the food too.

The next day, we drove on the way to the Ishasha sector to continue our game drives and hope to find the trees climbing lions (bad luck, we did not find them). Installation at the Topi Lodge. Beautiful rooms, impeccable service, very good food.
In general, the landscapes of Queen Elizabeth NP are splendid, but if you are used to safari in Kenya or Tanzania, the fauna is poor.

BWINDI IMPENETRABLE NATIONAL PARK

After breakfast, direction Bwindi by a catastrophic road. Off the tracks, the road to access Bwindi is a mountain road with a huge gap on the side, huge crevasses, significant road insecurity (and yet I have traveled before in a lot of countries where the roads were neither finished nor started).

Installation at Bweza Gorilla Lodge, which is one of the most beautiful lodges I have had the opportunity to see. The rooms are spacious, splendid and the view breathtaking. The food is good and the service is great.

The next morning, departure for the Gorilla Trekking. We hiked about 6 hours, including one with the gorillas. The forest is aptly named impenetrable. A good physical condition is necessary to enjoy this trek but seeing a silverback is a reward that has to be earned. The flora of this forest is also a splendor.
We loved meeting the gorillas and observing them.

Unfortunately, unlike the trek with the chimpanzees where THEY were our guides, the rangers disturbed the gorillas a lot during this ¢®¡Æhunt¢®¡¾. By dint of wanting to please the tourist by removing the branches behind which the gorillas settled (including a female with her three-week-old baby), one of them must have come to get angry and hit the ground in front of a ranger.
I think despite everything that it is an experience to live, hoping that our case was isolated and that most guides and rangers are more respectful.

We leaved the forest with wet feet (you have to walk in streams, in the mud, ¢®?) and clothes full of mud (we fell a lot ah ah).

BEGINNING OF BIG PROBLEMS
After our visit with the gorillas, we were supposed to go doing our PCR tests in anticipation of our departures the next day and then reach Lake Bunyonyi for a relaxation before the return route to Entebbe and our respective return flights the day after. This whole part (had to be) had been organized by the agency.

Arrived at the laboratory in Kabale (still being dirty and with wet feet), it is explained to us that I could have my results before my departure the following evening but that my father could not have his before his scheduled departure the following day at 3pm. Big panic! 
Our guide tries to negotiate but fails. For more than two hours, we stayed there watching our guide making calls and talk with the lab technician, hardly speaking to us anymore, not keeping us informed of events or what solutions we had. In the meantime, I took my test on the spot since they assured that the results would arrive no later than 4 pm the next day and that I had to be at the airport by 9 pm.

Also, we found a flight for my father that could leave the following evening, which would have allowed the tests to arrive on time. Our guide refused this option and forced us to take the road to Entebbe at that time for an express test there, open 24 hours a day. We fell from the clouds.

We of course had no choice and left for 9 hours of driving, always with wet feet and disgusting clothes, without even going to the lodge which was planned at the lake and which we had paid for, after 6 hours of hiking + hours waiting at the lab.

We arrived at the express laboratory at 4 am, after an extremely dangerous 9-hour drive (trucks driving with full headlights and coming straight at us, for example) where our guide refused to pay the difference between the standard test and the express test at first. He finally accepted full responsibility and paid the difference.

We arrived at the hotel (Airport GuestHouse, the same as on arrival) at 4:45 am and my father received his results at 6 am.
After having slept for 2 hours, we had breakfast and the spirits had calmed down, reassured to know that my father was going to be able to take his flight.

The guide apologized, refunded me the lake lodge we hadn't been to, and seemed sincere in taking responsibility.

I had planned to normally go visit the Mabamba swamp after my father left at the airport, for $100, to be given to the guide. Counting on the sincerity of our guide's apology, I decided to keep this plan and go with him. I asked him to call the lab before leaving for the ferry to make sure my results would be there as planned, between 3 and 4 pm. The lab apparently confirmed.

To get to the peninsula, you have to take a ferry. Count at least half an hour for all cars to board, cyclists and pedestrians (passengers cannot stay in vehicles during boarding and crossing).

The Mabamba swamp is absolutely beautiful and I had the opportunity to see a shoebill there as well as a lot of other birds. Do not hesitate to go there, it is really worth it. And this little canoe safari is really soothing.

At 5 pm, as we head back to the mainland, I asked my guide to call the lab back because my results had still not arrived. From the tone of his voice, I immediately knew there were a problem. After hanging up, he told me that my results are not ready and that they will not be ready until 9:30 pm (I had to be at the airport at 9 pm).

I was then completely panicked, alone in Uganda, and asked him to rush to the ferry to take an express test (the results of which normally arrive in 2 hours). We arrive at the ferry, fortunately there is a place for us. The time of boarding, crossing and road to the hotel, we arrive on site at 7 pm and my guide has still not taken the responsibility to call the express lab. He finally does it, summoned by the manager of the hotel to whom I tell my problems.

The laboratory assistant arrives on site, gives me the express test and my guide refuses to pay it. Exasperated and absolutely wanting to go home, I handed him ?©¡100 to pay for my test (he had to go to the bank to change them into shillings, the lab not accepting euros).
So they go together to the bank, him and the laboratory technician, each in its car. Arrived at the bank, the technician gets out of her car, and my guide leaves with my money¢®?¢®?¢®?¢®?

Despite the warnings of the laboratory, the hotel manager and mine for more than two hours, he will not return. The manager took his license plate number and threatened to call the police.

Fortunately, the laboratory still agreed to do my test, seeing the state I was in and sent me the results. I offered to pay them (so I would have paid for 3 tests in case) but they refused, the fault being entirely that of the guide (and moreover, everyone had seen that I had given him the 100?©¡ for the test ? and not to settle the walk at the swamp as he seemed to justify after the threat of the police).

At 9:45 pm, while I was waiting for boarding at the airport, I received a message from the hotel and the laboratory telling me that he had come to apologize for his bad decision, that he had paid the test and wanted to take me to the airport. A few minutes later, he was also texting me apologizing.

CONCLUSION
Uganda is an absolutely beautiful country with splendid landscapes. The encounter with the great apes is an incredible experience.
The country is, I think, the poorest and saddest I have seen and the roads in a catastrophic state and a great danger, especially when there is a void of several hundred meters nearby.

I have always used Tripadvisor to choose my local agencies and itineraries, but it seems all the more important to me today after this experience.

I recommend this itinerary if you are in good shape and physical health, if you are adventurous and if you have the right guide/driver.
The country will certainly have changed in a few years and if I had known, I think I would have waited before going there.

Of course, I absolutely DO NOT RECOMMAND Epic Uganda Vacation.

Do not hesitate if you have any questions.

You will pay everything accommodations that are 20 USD a night, will be charged 200 USD!!! Your 4x4  will break down, and be replaced  by an older 4x4. When stranded on the side of the road, both ladies will not be contactable, and when you reach them, they will say ""Let Me Tell You Something..."" and make excuses on why the vehicle is poor condition and say hang up the phone on you.  You will wait for hours in the heat on the side of the road, or late at night on rainy wet dangerous roads. Your life will be in danger and your safety and security will be compromised.  They will change the itinerary with out informing you and or contacting the driver. And when asked questions, they will not be reachable again or they will yell at you on the phone and then shut the phone and turn off the device, leaving you stuck. There answer will always be ""Let the driver figure it out, I am driving"" or shut the phone when you are serious distress. They will rob you of such an incredible country with so much to offer. They will not know the location of specific activities, they will overcharge you and say ""No"" after yes earlier was already confirmed. I cannot imagine a tour service company can talk to a customer in such an extremely rude way. They are not able to adapt to changes in the scheduling based on weather, and roads and conditions and will say ""If you miss the activity you will not be refunded and it is your fault."" There idea of tour operator is simply booking the accommodations, overcharging, and leaving you fend for yourself. Overall, I wasted the best experience of Uganda, which is an amazing country.  While I understand that no tour is perfect and mistakes happen, I do expect any company to try to make things right in the end, and not yell and scream at the customer and especially hang phone up on you while stranded because of a hazardous vehicle.  I found their lack of integrity on the follow up shocking. And I'm sad because we were psychologically treated like second class citizens and missed what Uganda has to offer.

What was meant to be a guide was just a rude semi illiterate driver who had no clue about what a guides role is, never mind that we had been promised that we would have the services of an 'experienced tour guide'. Poor customer experience. You do not get value for money. They are big on brand, but zero content. "
Liu,CN,Visited: September 2023,29-Nov-23,20-35,first safari,Seven By Far Travel,1,Don¢®?t choose Seven by far as your Kenya tour agency,"This was an extremely disappointing service experience. Shocking, Unbelievable,infuriating and even desperate.
Seven by far is an untrustworthy, extremely unprofessional company that only good at avoiding responsibilities.Complete lack of credit and integrity. I strongly advise everyone to never choose seven by far as your agency to Kenya and Tanzania. They will ruin everything!
Imagine what kind of experience it is when you are in a completely strange environment, in a strange country, without any preparation,BUT can't reach your travel agent.We felt so  helpless!They didn¢®?t even pay the accomodation money to the hotel!We certainly had the ability to take the initiative to resolve some of the issues, and in fact we did, under duress, because if we didn't act, our entire vacation plans would go down the drain. But what about our pre-agreed contract? We gave an offer and you accepted it, and since you accepted it, it means that you should have the ability to arrange everything within the budget, right?No one forced you to accept it, we paid for it, but then you played the disappearing act and just left us four girls in a camp that was downgraded without any prior notice. Instead of being able to enjoy our vacation and have fun every day, we have to act as seven by far¢®?s employees and solve THEIR business problems. May I ask if Seven by far will pay us a salary?
The truth is that there was already an sign of this during the pre-negotiation of the trip and budget, and after we paid the deposit, SEVEN BY FAR's attitude took a 180 degree turn, Mr.Sylvester blocked me on WhatsApp,just to intimidate us into thinking that they were going to run away with the money at any moment, what a ridiculously childish act! Unbelievable!
During our travels in Africa, seven by far repeatedly defaulted on payments to our partner companies, drivers, guides, and hotels, causing our trip to be irreparably affected. (FYI this is not the first time seven by far has done this.) There was even fake money involved, I am speechless.Not mention that they downgraded our accommodation many times without any prior notice.
When we finally met with the person in charge of seven by far, the lady promised us that she would compensate us, and then we also negotiated the amount of the payout on WhatsApp (although the amount could hardly make up for our loss), but after all this time we still haven't gotten the money, and Mr.Sylvester would only say over and over again that it's being processed, so please bear with them.
So one of us posted a bad review on safari booking and guess what?Mr.Sylvester quickly contacted us and said no more compensation. Haha! What a shameless and unrepentant businessman!
You are a shame of Kenya."

Enrico's tour was a nightmare, he took all our money and STOPPED PAYING for our accomodions and meals after day 3. He left us alone with the driver and no tour guide. WE HAD TO PAY FOR OUR OWN ACCOMODATION FOR TWO NIGHTS, AS WELL AS ALL THE MEALS AND ACTIVITIES WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. He simply booked everything, and we were forced to pay out of pocket if we wanted a bed for the night. When we called Enrico, he was never reachable and when he did respond, he repeatedly lied to us. He even said he would give us our money back upon return to Windhoek, which never happened. The driver stopped multiple times because Enrico did not send the payment for the gas, which kept us waiting for hours. Please stay away from Enrico's tours."

The travel agent did not disclose all of the fees, and, we're not sure, but suspect there may be some kind of kick-back scam. Were were also mislead us about the quality and type of safari vehicle, and then tried to back-date an email (which, of course, doesn't work), to try to ""prove"" we were given the information up front (we were not). The same vehicle was used to drive from Nairobi to the Mara as was used for the game drives. At least two of the seat belts were not functioning, and the ones that did clip were questionable if they would hold during an accident because they were so worn out. The vehicle was fine for the game drives, but certainly not a safe way to travel on Kenyan roads, particularly on the escarpment road with heavy truck traffic, lots of potholes, passing, and no guard rails. That said, the driver/guide was good.
Strongly recommend against booking with this company because of questionable ethics."

We even had to submit a criminal complaint to the Namibian Police and to the Tourist Officie, involving Diplomatic Authorities and discovering he has several other cases pending. We have booked a 11 days safari with some friends, all experienced travellers in Botzwana and Namibia. We have faced several serious problems since the beginning: to make a long story short different service (or no service at all)  from what booked, total lack of comunication. The most serious experience was the following: We were abandoned in the middle of the Jungle and we had to find an emergency place to survive and to book a private plane to escape from that mess. For what we understood Mr. Enrico's policy seems to be simple: to play with the good faith of his suppliers and clients and, at the end,  to try to not pay them/not give to them the service booked....keeping the clients'money in his pockets. Moreover Mr. Enrico uses as guides freelances in order to claim him unresponsable for them and vice-versa. Therefore sometimes the suppliers abandon him and his clients. In our experiences Mr. Enrico just ignored the problems hoping that the clients will find a solution by theirselves and they will not prosecute him for relative small money. All is organization and way of doing business is based on that ""philosofy"". Stay away from him. "

The driver and guides they hired were nice people. They were freelancers and not attached to Nairobi Tours Promoters & Safaris itself. 

However the instructions they gave our drivers were minimal, which caused us to miss the morning game drive in the Masai Mara. This game drive would require an extra 24 hour permit to the park ($70 p.p. plus a fee for the vehicle) that we've paid for and did not receive. During the trip we mailed and called with the company and they ensured us that they would look into it and that they would talk with the driver.

after our trip we received the following mail 

""Hi Lotte,
Hallo and thank you. I have met the driver and will finalize your refund of US$ 160 for Masai Mara. I have spoken to my boss and will deposit the money before the end of the week. Kindly bear with me for any inconveniences caused. Thank you in advance!

Best Regards,
Vickson""

However, we never received anything. We contacted Vickson again and heard that he wasn't working for the company anymore and that we should ask for Benard. It was strange that no one else of the company mentioned this to us as every mail we send to Vickson, was also send to the mail address of Nairobi Tours Promoters & Safaris. After contacting that same mail address we received a series of mails that were full of things that Vickson did wrong (which we aren't really interested in) and that we should've contacted them while we were still in the Masai Mara. The fact that we contacted them the day afterwards with someones elses phone and the first bit of WiFi we encountered somehow wasn't good enough. Two of the mails we received are listed below.

Mail 1
""well mr Lotte , i could feel your your wrath and personally i could have
the money you demand leave the company i could seatle it despite  having
the driver speak otherwise and also victor making a decision withiout

incitation from some quarters or because of what , nevertheless i still
would tell you shelve the decision to recommend the company negatively.

Mail 2:
""yea mr lotte you know we had alot of infighting within the

Louise,IE,Visited: August 2023,12-Aug-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Northern Fox Adventure Tours,1,Terrible company,"I was unfortunately really disappointed with this tour company. They are almost con artists and extremely unprofessional.
I was doing this tour as a solo female traveller. I requested to be part of a group and waited until other people were booked before booking myself. I was told that there were other people booked in for the same dates and I could join that tour. When I was collected by the tour company, I was very casually told that everyone else had cancelled and I would be alone for the entire trip. This was never communicated to me before being collected in Entebbe. I specifically asked when booking to be a part of a group as I wanted to meet other people on my travels and wanted to have company for meals and long car journeys. Eddie¢®?s attitude about this was very disrespectful and casual, as if it was not a big deal. It appears this company does not understand that a tour is supposed to be more than one person.
Day 1 of the itinerary was a 40 minute drive from Entebbe to Kampala. I was not offered a city tour. Day 1 started at 10am and was finished at 11am and I was in the room alone until day 2. As I was the only person on the tour, I couldn¢®?t go for a walk with people or eat in company and meet new people as I had planned and had to stay in my room all day. When checking out of the accommodation on day 3, I had to very uncomfortably ask my guide to pay for my dinners numerous times as I was told these were included in the price. There was a breakdown in language here that meant I had to go back and forth with him to get him to pay. A very uncomfortable situation that could have easily been avoided if the tour company communicated with their staff better.
On Day 3, it was a total of 11.5 hours to get to the accommodation. We stopped for 15mins at the equator to take a picture and use the toilet. There was no informative talk as it said in my itinerary. My driver got lost twice and asked me to use my Google maps for him as he had no data? When I eventually arrived at the camp and began check in, my guide told me that a different camp had called to ask where we were. Then Eddie called to say we were at the wrong camp even though I had the name of the camp in my itinerary from Northern Fox. My accommodation had been changed without any notice and we then had to drive back the way we came from to get to the new accommodation. I was then texted by Eddie to say that I would only be staying for 1 night instead of 2 and I was being moved to a different accommodation again for the last night which was not the plan I was given. I was told the new camp would be ¢®¡Æbetter¢®¡¾ but I was the only person staying at the entire camp and again, did not get to meet any other travellers. 
Day 4 was finished by 3pm and I was taken to my accommodation which looked nice and I was happy to hear there was a pool. The pool was absolutely filthy. I could not swim in it. Again, I was the only person from a tour staying at this accommodation so I ate alone again in an empty restaurant and did not get to meet anyone. 
On Day 5, while travelling back towards Entebbe, my guide mentioned we were 2 hours from the Forest Cottages. I asked how far that was from Entebbe and he said ¢®¡Æno we are going to Kampala¢®¡¾. I told him I needed to be dropped at a specific hotel in Entebbe, as I had an early morning flight, and I had already told Eddie this prior to booking the tour. I had also told my guide this the day that he collected me. Again, he just laughed casually and said ¢®¡Æno problem¢®¡¾. 
I am very disappointed with this tour and I am very confused why it cost $1540. I know the gorilla permit cost $740, but given the poor quality accommodation on day 1,2 and 3 I don¢®?t know why this trip was so expensive. There were no bottles of water available for me in the car either, which I always had on my tour in Kenya so this was very annoying as it was supposed to be covered in the cost and I had to keep asking for it to be provided. 
A warning to people considering booking this - this is NOT a 5 day itinerary. It is 2 days of activities and 3 days of travel. 
I had good intentions to support a local company rather than an international travel company but I will not do it again. This company were very unprofessional and treated everything very casually when it was clearly causing me upset. If this were an international company I would be seeking a partial refund but given how carelessly Northern Fox treated my custom, I know they would not provide it. I understand there is a large cultural difference and that Ugandan people are very calm and take things very easy, but this approach does not meet international or European standards for service. You do not get what you pay for here. The issues I encountered while traveling alone were stressful and I would never book with them again. The two days of activities were fun, but this company ruined my trip."

3. We made the mistake of adding an unplanned point (Victoria Falls from the Zimbabwean side) to the trip.  They not only charged us exorbitantly, but also charged us for services not rendered, and refuse refund the excess charge."

Chose a driver that was urinating outside of the car instead of in the latrines. This one forgets that I have booked a different hotel, takes my box lunch without asking me, forgets to tell my hotel manager that I need early breakfast to join the tour.
Asked (Peter) for more money (160US$) the first day we met saying that he needed it for the park fees. I had paid everything at least 2 weeks  earlier. I was said that he asks extra money to all his clients.
Entered into a fight with the brother of a former employee right in front of me.
Set a transfer downtown Nairobi knowing the traffic Jams while it could have been done outside of the city.
Did not send enough money to the mountain operator so that I had to wait 36 hours in Moschi Tanzania, before going to the mountain. I finally had to do the climbing in 5 days instead of 6.
Was saying that the money was coming in the minutes to come but it took a whole day.
Did not give enough money to my Kenyian guide so that he has to take his own money and I had to help him with mine.

Day 2: We were instructed to go by the office enroute to lake Nakuru, to pick up a refund for the park fees we paid on day 1, and additional park fees for Lake Nakuru and Mara trips, this added another one hour plus to our 5 hour plus drive.

#1: The day they picked me up from the airport, the driver asked if I had paid for the transport. Yes I had. I don't understand why the driver would not know this. I paid for this trip as a complete package. The tour operators should communicate this. I received no pamphlet, brochure, or information packet upon arriving at my hotel. I was told to go to bed and rest and the next morning I would be given an orientation.
#2: The morning of my trek, I woke up to have breakfast and was told I would have an orientation. I was expecting a detailed orientation, but didn't get this. Instead, a man in a business suit sat down next to me at breakfast, asked if I had comfortable shoes and everything I needed. He looked at me and said, ""You look fit, you'll be fine. Your guide will be here soon."" I was very shocked at how little information and preparation I was getting given"
Luigi Chiacchio,IT,Visited: August 2018,26-Aug-18,35-50,first safari,Bencia Africa Adventure & Safaris,1,Not reliable and fraudsters,"I booked a tour with the agency Bencia Africa Adventure & Safaris based in Nairobi, starting from Kenya - Nairobi and that was to end in Tanzania - Arusha and then continue to Zanzibar.  The tour involved crossing the large parks to follow the migrations, more than visits to sites of interest along the way.  Obviously we knew that being in Africa and in a country where accuracy is not there we would have to adapt and not ask too many questions even if the price we had paid for two was very high.  In any case, as we expected, throughout the trip we were not adequately informed about the program, giving us vague information and changing it continuously program, in fact three times we have changed the structures where to sleep, previously communicated, changing them with others not always of the same level proposed and the discovery of the change occurred only on the spot, without giving us the opportunity to accept or change.  The first excursion was to Mount Kenya where we were told a generic ""let's visit a cave"", but we were not told that there were four hours of trekking and that we had to be equipped for a very rough path.  The moral of the fairy tale, after half an hour of march a storm broke out and not being equipped we had to go back.  And so it was throughout the trip.  The most serious episode that happened and that ruined us all the rest of the holiday happened after 5 days of travel, when we arrived at the northern border between Kenya and Tanzania.  They told us that they had to wait for their next guide before continuing their journey.  They left us at a taxi saying that the driver would wait for us in the next city because he couldn't come there, we didn't have many problems because we were used to that way of doing and we went to the meeting in the next city.  The guide we met, after a long wait, on the trip told us that he was a replacement for our driver who had the car broken and that would wait for us in the Serengeti Park.  The trip was tremendous because he ran like a damned because we understood he didn't pay much and he wanted to get rid of us soon.  We made the whole trip without water and lunch that were included.  Arrived at the entrance of the park told us that we had to pay the entrance, which was already included in the price, but told us that not being he our guide, once arrived we would refund, we trusted and we paid.  Once we arrived we immediately realized that the place was not the one we had booked.  We had booked a tent with beds and instead brought us to a public field with a tent where we slept on the ground.  The guide was not there and we tried to get him called by the person who had brought us them, telling us that he would arrive after an hour and a half.  We waited for the guide and in the meantime we called the agency asking for explanations on the spot that was not the one booked, also because we did not know it, we were not equipped to camp, after my continuous insistence answered me that it was too expensive the tent with beds and changed structure and attached me to the phone not answering me anymore.  We waited for the guide who had never arrived and stayed in the camp for two days without water or food, providing our own needs.  We stayed two days in the camp sleeping in this public tent with sleeping bags recovered who knows where, because we didn't have the chance to leave, we were stuck and every now and then some characters told us that someone would arrive who never arrived.  We were wandering in this camp that was not sure, so much so that one night a hyena chased us and we had to escape.
By day the camp was empty and we were left only two close to the tent and a small structure where they ate.  We were really desperate, until we managed to bargain with a guy a passage to Arusha, interrupting the journey that was ruined.  But not having the entry tickets to the park that the driver had brought with him, we would have had to pay the 400 dollars of the passage, the fine for tickets that we did not have, the two days of stay in the camp and the entry and exit in the park of Ngorongoro that necessarily had to pay to get out of the parks.  At that point we decided to call the rangers who brought us to the police where we made the complaint and where magically occurred the driver who had disappeared.  He was very surprised by the complaint and he justified himself by saying that the car had broken down and that he was finding a solution, he offered to let us continue the journey with him but we did not accept, the police forced him to give us the money of the entrance to the park, he paid us the car until Arusha and crossing the other parks.  We also had to pay one night in the hotel, but once we got there the driver told us that he didn't have the money but we were relieved to have come out of that nightmare and we were very happy to be able to choose us a structure and get rid of them.  The agency came alive when it heard about the complaint, apologizing and justifying that it had relied on this partner in Tanzania and that would have made us pay ... to date has never arrived anything.  But the fact that I explained that it was his responsibility, because I had made a contract with him and that in the moment of need he had disappeared was a concept difficult to understand.  We are now trying to find a solution to get compensation even though we know that it is impossible to get it.

Maybe we were a bit unfortunate but nothing justifies their way of behaving and the absolute lack of professionalism, exposing ourselves to risks and leaving us in a foreign land at the mercy of ourselves.  Even just because of the stress their behaviour causes you, absolutely avoid them."

If a deposit means something different in Tanzania than America it would have been nice to know. African Big Cats advertises one lodge on their website but downgrades last minute to another. The downgraded lodge is on the complete opposite side (East/West-of Zanzibar) and rooms smell terribly of mold/mildew. Two safari days were not needed (the first and last). Those need to be removed from the itinerary completely. Note that most of these safari companies go to the same exact spots. As evidenced by the massive amount of jeeps at every stop and animal sighting. Skip African Big Cats and go with one of the MANY other companies. Our guides (Zab and Jumma) were good!!

Our transfers were all late and we constantly had to pry the itinerary information from our guides - especially in Tanzania.  Once off the paved roads, the roughest roads, travelled at break-neck speeds to get to the next park on time, left us with headaches and feeling like we had concussions.   The Accommodations posted were NOT where we stayed.  Our $400 per day got us backpacker, communal, horrible campsites/campgrounds (NOT CAMPS as they advertised), sleeping on the ground with a 1 inch ripped foam pad, sleeping bags that were so over-laundered the fill was lumpy (mine was pink with fun-fur around the top), NO pillows, NO towels provided and NO notice given that they would NOT be provided (at Ngorongoro Crater in in Serengeti Park).  Further we were required to leave one of our duffel bags behind at the first camp, as we were told there was no room for our luggage - also were never informed there were space restrictions.  Our itineraries were always changing and our last transfer information - back to Nairobi - was not received until 10pm at night.  After spending an hour at a repair shop to fix the safari truck and told the Tour Rep would come to the hotel with our transfer information - he refused to attend the hotel and texted our transfer information at 10 pm. 
After many persistent complaints made with the booking company -TourRadar - where WE provided internet research with photos, to provide proof of East Africa Safari Bookers' - and their counterpart in Tanzanias' MISREPRESENTATION  and fly-by-night operation', we were given a partial refund.   
We do see that their descriptions have now changed for this tour to indicate 'basic' accommodations, but let me inform anyone who is considering booking this tour - your accommodation in Amboseli - while being a cute camp at the base of Kilimanjero - the floors in the cabins are so slanted you will roll across your bed,  The 'campsite' in Ngorongoro Crater  and Serengeti is backpacker/ communal where all the camp staff make so much noise you will not sleep before 11 pm and then will be jarred awake at about 4:30 am.  Your tent could be set as far as 100 yards/meters from the washroom buildings - so be sure to say your prayers if you need to use the bathroom in the middle of the night.  This tour is rated for AGES 2 to 85.  I would love to see a 2 year old or 85 year old survive these accommodations.  

The only good part of this trip were the animals we were able to see, though our tour guide/driver in Tanzania did little to position the vehicle for good photos  - we had to keep asking to move ahead of back.  
Please see the photos posted on the TourRadar review platform to see for yourself what we paid for and WHAT WE GOT!!!!

Maarten,US,Visited: September 2021,18-Nov-21,20-35,2-5 safaris,Taste Of Afrika Safaris,1,2 hours late and ripping me off,"Booked a day trip to Arusha NP with Seka from Taste of Africa. The guide was supposed to pick me up at 7.30, but at the agreed time there was no one to be seen. No one from the company was available until I got a call from Seka at 8:55 AM. He told me that there was a problem, but that it was solved and that he would come in half an hour. At 9:25 AM I was finally picked up by Seka and the guide, after which we still had to leave for Arusha NP.

Seka left and I continued with the guide and we were only at the park well after 11 o'clock, where we then also had to wait at the entrance because the entrance fee had not yet been paid...

We had a nice day and the guide did his best, but was not very experienced and often busy taking selfies. He didn't know the answer on many questions and didn't know the animals very well. He also said that unfortunately this was not the first time that Taste of Afrika was late, because the owner was a drunk and often overslept.

We nearly ran out of time to see the entire park, but luckily we managed to do so in the end because the guide drove very fast.

I didn't get a discount on this day trip, but could get a discount on another day trip. However, I got the same price as quote as I've had before, so Seka wanted to rip me off again.

I would definitely not recommend Taste of Africa."
Maas,NL,Visited: July 2023,10-Aug-23,50-65,2-5 safaris,Pamoja Tours and Travel (Entebbe,2,A deal is not a deal!,"Early this year, we started orientating for a trip to Kenya with our family. 2 tour operators jumped out and both offered a similar trip for a similar price. We chose Pamoja because they offered the beach hotel which was our preference. Whereupon we signed the offer and paid the trip deposit.

6 weeks before departure, we got word from Pamoja that 2 hotels (including the beach hotel) had become more expensive. Whether we wanted to pay an extra USD 11,400. This made our trip no less than 50% more expensive than agreed with us in the quotation and confirmation. We were very shocked by this and it caused the necessary unrest and emotions within our family. Because of this, it was not clear whether we could still go on the trip at all because of these extra costs. After a week of almost daily contact with Pamoja, they could not do more for us than deduct USD 3200. Still a difference of USD 8200. Still too much for us. By now it was 5 weeks before departure and booking through another tour operator was not very easy anymore. In the end, we opted for cheaper hotels for which we had to pay USD 2000,- extra. Unfortunately, we later had two more discussions about finances, which completely destroyed our trust in Pamoja and the fun before departure.

Fortunately, we can look back on a great trip through Kenya. The whole trip including transport, hotels and other logistics were well arranged by Pamoja. Our guides David and Alan were very professional and nice to travel with. They showed us many beautiful things and knew a lot to tell. For this, we are very grateful to them."
Madden,US,Visited: July 2019,08-Aug-19,20-35,first safari,Trip Advisor Africa Safaris,2,Misleading Information + Unprofessional Response... Can book same safari with more reliable company,"If you want to skip reading the review, here's just a quick list of reasons you shouldn't book with Seth Vincent and things that were PROMISED TO BE INCLUDED in our safari package that WERE NOTFirst nights stay in Nairobi, visit to elephant orphanage, giraffe sanctuary, farewell dinner at Carnivore, a limited number of people in a van, and adequate amounts of daily drinking water. He just wants to find any way to take your money! 
As two college students who booked a ""budget"" safari, and have been to Africa before, we went into our trip with no expectation, knowing that traveling over there is an adventure of it's own! We booked a 6 day safari through Seth Vincent and initial communication was clear. Once the deposit was paid, however, his communication became a little more sporadic and it was unclear how we were going to transfer the remaining balance, as we made it known we did not want to travel with that much cash. Anytime we sent an email asking questions about anything prior to landing in Nairobi his response was nothing other than ""it will be fine.""
In the email he sent with our itinerary, he said that our first nights stay upon landing in Kenya was paid for in the cost of our safari. He never booked us a place to stay, or gave us money from the safari package to put towards a hotel, so we booked and paid for our own hotel in Nairobi (which wouldn't have been a big deal if he wouldn't have told us that a room was included in the package and then lied when we asked him about it)
Upon landing in Kenya we were picked up by a driver named Samuel! He was great and according to him, and the itinerary that Seth Vincent had sent us, someone would be meeting us at our hotel to go over what the rest of the week was going to be and someone was going to take us to the elephant orphanage and giraffe sanctuary. No one ever came and we were instructed to be ready for pickup the following morning. 
Seth arrived as we were departing for our safari and took us to an ATM where he had us withdraw the remaining balance for our safari after we had asked multiple times if we could just wire the money the same way we had paid the deposit. 
After taking our cash he dropped us off at a van where he told us that the van would exceed no more than 6 people. Well, after just a few minutes of waiting the van was completely full (9 people) and we were stuffed elbow to elbow with people from a different tour company that Seth evidently partners with. So, the number of people he told us would be on safari was false, which at the start wasn't a huge deal, but after being stuffed into a van for numerous days on bumpy roads, it got a little too crowded and very uncomfortable.
Then the amount of water that was promised to us each day was not given... to the point that I was so dehydrated I was vomiting (there is water available for purchase at the camps so we just ended up buying water for ourselves... which also wouldn't have been a big deal if Seth Vincent would have just been honest about the amount of water we were going to receive)
Upon returning to Nairobi after the safari, we never heard from Seth (he would have never known if we even made it back to Nairobi) so we reached out about the ""complimentary dinner at Carnivore"" that is promised in the itinerary, along with the visits to the elephant orphanage and giraffe sanctuary. He told us that because we didn't go on the first day (BUT THE REASON WE DIDNT GO IS BECAUSE HE NEVER SHOWED UP) he wasn't required to take us to see the elephants and giraffes (and was incredibly rude about it), but he offered to arrange to take us AT AN ADDITIONAL COST (to something we already paid for!!) and when I asked about the farewell dinner at Carnivore he flat out told me no. When I asked to be compensated for the first night's stay in Nairobi he also told me no, even though HIS INITIAL EMAIL STATES THAT HE WILL PAY FOR IT. He asked for additional money to arrange visits to the elephants and the giraffes and dinner. So we just took an uber and planned a day for ourselves.
The safari itself was magical. We absolutely loved our first driver, Jeffery Bruce. Everything about the Maasi Mara is absolutely breathtaking, but you can book the same safari with other companies for cheaper (We were put into a van with another company and everyone who booked through them paid less than we did (and seemed to be given what they were told in their itineraries)
Our second driver, James, was AWFUL. He drove on the wrong side of the road on a busy highway on the way to Amboseli and didn't notice until someone told him... and FELL ASLEEP multiple times while driving on the safari.
Our safari went to the Mara, Nakuru, and Amboseli... we both agreed that if we had to do it all over again we would book a 5 day safari (through a different company) and only go to the Mara and Nakuru (Amboseli is cool, but not nearly as fascinating as the Maasi Mara and a lot more work to get to than it is worth!
Go on a safari... just book it through someone that's honest!"
Madlen,IS,Visited: February 2014,11-Sep-14,50-65,first safari,Lilac Adventures Limited,2,"Never again with Lilac Adventures Limited from Kenya, known also as East Africa Holidays!","We contracted them for a safari in Kenya and Tanzania in July 2014. In Tanzania our fundamental rights have been put at risk by being forced to drive in the dark, to remain without fuel in the savanna, very far from the lodge, just before the sunset, to be forced to use a broken and technically precarious and unsafe car and so on. To any of our or driver phone calls it was no answer from the company! We can easily say: we have been abandoned!
During the 4 days for which we paid luxury conditions, we experienced hours of waiting at the border for the car that was supposed to transfer us to the first location, one day without food, no visits at the Maasai village in Serengeti, no visit to the Old Uvai, although both included in the safari cost, and all in all, the game drives rendered to us could be counted as lasting only for one day instead of the four we paid. We have been spent the rest of the days waiting for payments never done in time or for repairing the car or even worse waiting for someone to tow the car without fuel in the middle of nowhere, but plenty of wild animals ready for hunting!"
Magnus Midander,SE,Visited: January 2020,30-Jan-20,35-50,first safari,Uhuru Travel & Tours,1,5 day safari became 4 days...,"We pre-booked a 5 day safari in November 2019 with Uhuru and Mr Abdallah. Good reviews on Tripadvisar and SafariBookings.com together with a fair pricing made us choose this company. 

This review is only for the company of Uhuru Travel & Tours Ltd and the owner Mr Abdallah and not for the safari and our guide Zabron which were both great!

We prepaid 60% of $4400 in November and the rest was supposed to be paid 10 days prior safari start. When trying to pay the rest (40% of $4400) the link sent by Mr Abdallah didn't work. I quickly responded and two days later I got a new link which worked and now 100% of the safari was paid. We had a conversation on WhatsApp and Mr Abdallah responded fairly quick that everything was fine and that we should enjoy our safari. When we asked for a pickup time the day before departure he responded ""Pick up can be 0730am or 0800am or 0900am.""

We waited. At 0747am we sent a message that we were ready for take off and Mr Abdallah responded: ""My Opertion manager will arrive there in time."" He did not.

5 minutes later he replied: ""We have a small problem with credit card payments... please pay $1300 for park fees"". "" We have cash flow problems"".

We responded that we already paid $4400 and did not trust him on paying an extra $1300.

3 hrs later a van came and picked us up and drove us to Mr Abdallahs hotel McEllys in Arusha were we had lunch on his account. That's when we realized that there won't be a 5 day safari. Several hours in the hotel restaurant and no response from Mr Abdallah on WhatsApp made us choose to stay one night at the hotel on his account. He now promised through his local manager Mr Roy to arrange a 4 day safari starting at 10am tomorrow.

Even after we started our now 4 day long safari Mr Abdallah did not communicate with us and we demanded to have some sort of compensation after missing an entire day of safari. It ended up with an upgrade to Acacia Luxury tent worth about $500 but this was not near our expectations of a compensation.

Please be aware of Uhuru Travels & Tours Ltd since their owner Mr Abdallah is not trustworthy nor reliable.

Since Mr Abdallah is replying on many reviews on both Tripadvisor and SafariBookings.com I hope yo understand that we had a horrible experience with him and his company regardless of what he replies.

Our safari ended well with a good view of the big 5 and many many more animals. Our driver and guide Mr Zabron was super!"
Malin,US,Visited: February 2020,18-Feb-20,20-35,first safari,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Wish I would have spent a little more money for a better company,"I read a lot of reviews before choosing this company (Karibu). I knew there were a lot of mixed reviews and some really bad reviews, I decided to take the gamble. I wish I would have paid a little bit more on a better company. But I guess you get what you pay for. I did the 4 day/3 nights Masai Mara + Lake Nakuru. 

I was picked up from the hotel 7:30am and taken to their office (literally a few blocks away from my hotel).  There we waited for a long time (1-1,5 hrs or so), I guess some other people in the group  were late too. I had to pay the remaining balance at the office but when we left at 9 am and passed right by my hotel I was bummed I had been up since 6 am haha 

We got an old van (sure, budget tour, didn¢®?t think more about it..) but after getting closer to Masai Mara park and the last 1,5 hours consisted of a bumpy dirt road, I really wanted to slap myself for not choosing a company with a Jeep or better vehicle. It was miserable the last 1,5 hours, my seat was slightly loose and I was shaking back and forth... it was awful. 

Once at the lodge, I guess it was okay. I mean, you get what you pay for.. I shared ¢®¡Ætent room¢®¡¾ with another solo guy (I¢®?m a solo female traveler). It was fine, but the toilet and shower only has a drape... so you can hear everything.. just so you know ;)  

We were unfortunate to get a bad driver/¢®¡Ætour guide¢®¡¾ -  James , his English was ok but he was terrible at communicating. He didn¢®?t explain or say anything the whole trip.. we had to ask if we wanted to know anything. The afternoon when we arrived to the Masai Mara and the lodge we were staying at and we were doing a evening Safari game drive.. however, it was never communicated that we had bring our passports for the game drive to get in to the park (we left them at the lodge). So when we arrived to the entrance with no passport he was almost shocked why we didn¢®?t bring them!? The tour was constantly like this, no communication AT ALL!! 

During our full day Safari, he pretty much said nothing about any animals or facts or anything! Sometimes we had to tell him to stop so we could take pictures of the animals. I wasn¢®?t expecting a A+ tour guide, but common.. at least maybe tell me something? 

The food at the lodge was very boring, carb and very little veggies and no fruit (2 out of 3 days). The last lodge was good, had veggies and fruit and we were all so happy to eat there! Haha (still nothing fancy!) 

3rd day we were told we had to switch van and join another group to continue our trip.. sure no problem. So we jumped into another companies van (not the same company I booked with). That van was a lot nicer, thank god! That driver (Richard) was also little but more informative at every stop and told us a little about the animals. 

Overall, be prepared to be disappointed...at least hopefully you get a better driver/tour guide than us. I wished I spent a little bit more money and got more out of my trip. Better food, better vehicle, more information about the animals, the park etc.. or any information at all would have been nice! I would not recommend this company to other travel friends. "
Mano,CA,Visited: September 2018,29-Sep-18,50-65,over 5 safaris,Trip Advisor Africa Safaris,2,Very poor organzation with outright cheating as we didn't get th promised game drives and hotels,"We went on a tour with Vincent Seth from Trip Advisor African Safaris(from the 7-24th of Sept 2018) and I would like to make the following comments.

We paid the money in 3 installments - First about 4 months ago, 2nd about a month ago and the last installment when we arrived in Nairobi (this is the way he asked).

Tour - Group = 12 to be accommodated in 2 vehicles as a private tour with an English speaking Driver/Guide. Tour 11days in Kenya/Tanzania with 5 of us doing an optional 4 day tour at the beginning in Zanzibar.

Day 1 - Zanzibar Driver who picked us up spoke practically no English(acceptable for this part bout not later when touring). We were to have 3 singles and 1 double but when we got there the hotel stated we were booked as a triple and 1 double. Had to contact Vincent (while sharing a room for the initial hours by 2 of us - 3rd arrived later) who corrected the problem. Excellent Hotel (Blue Bay Resort). The day we arrived we were to on a Spice Tour in the afternoon - Driver who dropped as well as his Zanzibar contact(Willie) didn't inform us that somebody would be arriving to at 2PM to pick us up (when we have gone on tours the driver before leaving gives clear cut instructions a to the next pick up time-but this didn't happen). We were in the restaurant but whoever arrived at 2PM didn't bother to look for us but left after a while(if he told the front desk they would have had no difficulty locating us as we were only 30 metres away).

Day 2 We went on the missed Spice Tour followed by the Old Town Tour - Guides very knowledgeable and overall very good tour; Suggestion - We were taken for lunch to a restaurant stating it is local food although the food was essentially Indian Food (which I know has a big influence on the local cuisine). There were other tourists there with the lunch acceptable. After the lunch during the tour we were taken to a colonial hotel with a nice restaurant overlooking the bay - It would have been better to give an option to the tourists to go to the usual place vs this restaurant (for an additional charge) as we anyway stopped there for tea, thus spending time.

Day 3All problems commenced. On our schedule we were to be taken for a boat tour to see Dolphins followed by lunch and a tour to local sanctuary for a visit including a Colobus Monkey viewing. We had a 2hr drive to go to the Dolphin site (+ 2hrs back). The driver spoke no English at all. When we reached the beach there wasn't a single other tourist there (thus I am not sure whom they sub-contracted to do the tour). The motor boat was fine but the life jackets provided were old and frayed with the zips not functional. There was only one additional straps on the jacket (usually has 2-3) with the no clips to latch. Thus we tied the 2 frayed ends with an hand done knot. This in my opinion is gross negligence and dangerous. As you are aware a large number of people died in a Ferry accident in Tanzania a few days ago. The boat driver again spoke very little English. After the boat ride the car driver stated that he was asked to take us back to the hotel and that he wasn't told about lunch/Colobus monkey tour. After our insistence he had a back and forth discussion with Willlie with the phone handed to us to argue with him with regards to provision of the remaining portion of the trip. After wasting nearly 1hr the driver was told to take us back to the boat area to a restaurant - When we taken to this beach side restaurant there was not a single customer in the restaurant and there was not a single staff person to be seen either. We certainly weren't prepared to have lunch there and asked the driver to take us back to the hotel. We were not expecting a fancy restaurant(I have eaten at many beachside cafes in the Caribbean) but this place wasn't suitable to have a meal. The only people in the restaurant were 4 young kids seated and playing cards.

Day 4Arrived in Nairobi. Taken to Sarova Stanley hotel- An excellent hotel. Vincent Seth was there. It took nearly 2hrs to get the rooms as Vincent had not made the bookings according to what we paid for ( 5 double/twin rooms and 2 singles). However we took this in good stride but informed Vincent that he needs to make a list citing  the names and the room allocations and fax it to all the other hotels in advance to expedite the check in. Vincent spent a lot of time asking us to write all the names in detail citing the room requirements (all this info was already sent to him beforehand). However the next day he brought a sheet written by him many names misspelt and handing over to us. I explained to him that he needs to fax this the hotels and there was no need to give each of us copies. The list was ultimately not faxed to any of the hotels except possibly one.

Day 5 (Tour Of Nairobi)Vincent arrived late and stated that another person from England was going to joining us in our tour. This was a total surprise as we were to have a private tour. Although the person was quite nice having the 7th person in the van resulted in limitations for space to carry luggage as well as inconvenience when trying to jockey for position during game viewing(especially in Tanzaniawhere the truck had only 7 Tour of Nairobi -although identified we were not taken to the Nairobi Natl park, Blixen Museum etc - Vincent had too many things on the schedule and the drivers didn't have copies of the schedules with them (This was an issue throughout the tour where not a single driver/guide had the schedule given to us.  Evening - Dinner at Carnivoro Restaurant - Nice

Day 6 Told by Vincent that we would reach Lake Nakuru in 2-3hrs (and we would have a full game drive there) with his drivers insisting that it would take 4-5hrs (the latter turned out to be correct). Nice Hotel

Day 7/8 Masai Mara - No issues although game drive on last day not done as road issues forcing a detour.

Day 9/10 Serengeti Serena Lodge - Excellent hotel and good game drives. When we went to check out of the hotel after staying 2 nights the Manager told us that we cannot leave as the hotel has not been paid for the 2 nights with only a deposit made. He wanted us to pay US$ 5100.00. We obviously refused but were held hostage at this hotel until 1145AM. We had to make dozens of phone calls to get hold of Vincent and his Tanzania agent (Ibrahim) to arrange for the payment. Ibrahim stated that Vincent hadn't paid him and Vincent stated that Ibrahim had played him out. In addition to the mental anguish we missed the morning game drive. If anybody disbelieves this please feel free to phone the Mgr at the Serengeti Serena - his name was Vincent as well

Day 10 -we were to be taken to the Ngorongoro Serena  Lodge for the night(as per our schedule) but the drivers stated that we should go to Lake Manyara Serena to allow for proper game drives at Ngorongoro as well as Tarangerie. Ultimately we had totally inadequate game drive at Ngorongoro and never got any worthwhile game drive at Tarangerie either(see reasons below). We were unfortunately na?ve to believe this with Vince stating later that the Ngorongoro Serena and the Lake Manyara Serena are similarly priced - however when I checked on the Serena website a few days ago the Ngorongora Serena was listed at US$480 and the Lake Manyara Serena at US$ 280.00 (thus we were cheated again). 

Day 11- We were driven to Tarangarie Natl Park(90 minutec drive) to be accommodated at the Sopa Lodge in Tarangerie for the night (as per original schedule). Throughout the day we had no confirmation from Vincent or Ibrahim as to where we are going (we repeatedly asked the drivers who stated that they were also not told). After doing a very short game drive(less than 2hrs) we were told that we are to be housed in Arusha (and not in the Tarngarie Park). We drove another 2 1/2 hrs and were taken to the Impala Hotel in Arusha - A very run down hotel with bare electrical wires hanging from the wall.

Day 12 - Amboseli - Good hotel but again as per schedule we were to be taken to the Amboseli Serena within the park for lunch - Instead box lunch given cutting their costs.

All in all the organization was terrible and I wouldn't recommend anybody to book with this company. I have been to numerous countries in the world in many continents but have never seen a person as disorganized as this. I simply do not believe some of the comments on the website stating Vincent was well organized unless we are referring to a different person. A prime example of his lack of understanding is illustrated by the following. My friend texted Vincent from Zanzibar asking him whether he could arrange a late check out as his flight was in the late afternoon (we left in the morning). The reply from Vincent was Jambo - ""I would be more than happy to arrange an early checkout for you with the hotel""!  As everybody is aware the cost for the tour at this site is substantially less than if you booked through an agent in North America. However this discount is essentially based on avoiding the commission charged by the agent in America - As ultimately they book though agents in the developing countries sometimes even go though other agents in UK etc (with everybody keeping a cut). We have booked though local agents and visited Vietnam, Laos, Thailand and recently Myanmar. We have never had this type of experience. In fact this was my 2nd visit to Kenya/Tanzania. When we went 15yrs ago we used an agent in Nairobi where the price charged was about $2000.00 less than the price asked by North American travel agents. We had absolutely no issues at that time with all hotels provided as per schedule with each driver having a copy of the schedule given to us. Having said all this the only redeeming feature was that we saw loads of wildlife during this tour with the experience exceeding our expectations. This as you know is partly luck and partly the efforts of the drivers. If by chance we didn't see much the trip would have been considered as one of the most terrible tours that I have had. The drivers/guides were quite good with a lot of knowledge on the animals including birds. However I felt that the drivers in Tanzania played us out working in conjunction with the agent - Missing 3-4 game drives, switching to cheaper hotels etc

Manu,FR,Visited: February 2020,27-Feb-20,20-35,2-5 safaris,Bencia Africa Adventure & Safaris,1,Terrible experience,"It will be a long review, but here you'll have all the details of how it goes with Bencia africa because it's seems a bit tricky to find a good safari agency. We did a safari in Masai Mara with them in january, they sold us 15 hours and 30 minutes of game drive in three days (first evening, then full day, and last one during the last morning). We bought it 280usd (you can find cheaper in other agencies and probably with them also...) for transportation (2 ways from Nairobi), food and tent (like military ones with shower inside). First, we left Nairobi 2 hours late, so we arrive at the Gate of the park, 2 hours late the first day (of course...). The van was so old it broken down the first day 200 meters after the entrance of the park, so no game drive the first day. The second one the program said ""game drive from 8.00am to 6.30pm"". At 5.00pm the driver reached the exit gate, we asked why so early, he answered ""it's a rule setted by the park""... And the next morning the program said ""game drive from 6.30am to 9.30am"", we did just one hour and then again the driver tried to explain that we were too late to continue the game drive... The driver doesn't care about the program (and passengers), so we requested the company to compensate the hours we didn't do inside the park, they sold 15hours and we did 10 !! Here start their funny answers. They first answered ""the 2 people we shared the van with were happy, so the company cannot make any refund"". I replied that we don't care about the feelings of the others in the van, we had a contract and nothing of it was respected. So they answered ""our driver made a detour of 40 minutes, so we consider this as a compensation"". Then i replied that we never asked for a detour but to be dropped on the way back to Nairobi to take a local bus to naivasha (but the driver brought us to naivasha even if i told him that we'll find a bus). Just for you to know, public transportation for Naivasha is about 1 dollar from there... So they tried to compensate the 5 hours in the park they stole us with a one dollar drive.
Then we continue to talk with them and finally they said that there will be a refund but we wait and we wait and nothing happen.
We just leave one star for George the cooker who's a really nice person and the only one with honesty in this company.
If you want more informations about our experience, don't hesitate to contact me. I have the screenshots of the WhatsApp conversation as a proof of what i write, and that i don't exagerate/inflate the reality. It's just for you to not make same bad choice than us."
Manu,ES,Visited: August 2018,03-Sep-18,20-35,first safari,Kiliholidays Tours & Safaris,2,It could have been better,"We didn't have the best experience with Kiliholidays Tours & Safari.

We booked a three-day-safari at Mikumi Park. The first day we couldn't access to the park. They told us ""drive to Mikumi National Park which is approximately 5 hours from Dar es Salaam"". It's totally false. It was 8 hours and a half. The driver drove at 45 km/hour and the arrival to the park was almost sunset. They saved the access to the park of the first day (which is included in the safari price). So we paid for something that we didn't enjoy.

Additionally, the car broke down several times. The first time it had refrigerator problems. It was solved and we continued. The second day, the car stop and it ran out the battery , we push the car in the middle of the safari :) . The third day we spent 8 hours and a half to Dar Es Salaam. There was a huge jam and the car spent all the battery. 

So, we had to take OTHER CAR with a non-known driver, and 3 minutes later ALSO the new car ran out of gas. Really? The driver (who didn't speak english) left the car in the middle of the darkness and 30 minutes later he appeared again with a bottle with gas.  We stay alone waiting for him without knowing what to do.

The only positive point was the safari driver, he was nice."
Mar?a,ES,Visited: March 2019,16-Mar-19,20-35,first safari,Orongai Africa Safari,1,Worst travel experience of my life due to Martha,"I do not recommend orongai safaris. We booked for a 5-day safari un Tanzania during calving season. We asked to different agencies for prices and orongai offered us the best price for the trip we desired. We closed the final budget in January and we paid for the 30%. One week before the trip they changed the budget and added another 650$ pp. We tried to  explain to Martha (that managing director of orongai) they couldn't do that. It was imposible to communicate by mail or phone with her, her messages were inconclusive, full of missenses. We told her we wouldn't pay the extra amount and she just responded""see you on Saturday please"". So we did the biggest miskate, we flew to Tanzania. Once there she insisted on the extra 650$ pp. Arguing with her is totally imposible. The Spanish ambassy put as in contact with Angel (from Itaka safari which I deeply thank) who came to try to help us. The night finished in the tourist police with Martha and angel. We finally had to pay 200$ pp extra and changed from a luxury safari to a midrage. Orongai sent us to tented camps were, some nights, not even the showers worked or we couldn't charge our cameras over night. Even if the safari itself was spectacular, Martha put us through one of the worst days of my life. By the way, Fred was a very nice guide while Asseri wasn't. He never put the Jeep in a good place for pictures, had a poor communication with us and barely told us any interesting things about the place or animals. Please stay away from Orongai, there are plenty of tour operators working much better!

Mar?a,ES,Visited: August 2018,23-Aug-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,African Home Adventure Safaris,1,The worst experience of our lifes,"I¢®?m writing this coment from Nairobi airport still shaking. Today me and 4 friends were coming back from Masai Mara area to Nairobi to have dinner and then take our flight home. We were in a van of the company ¢®¡ÆAfrica Home Adventure¢®¡¾.
During the way it started to rain and the traffic became very slow. After a couple of minutes, when we were next to the Riff Valley our driver decided to overtake some cars so he moved to the other lane (uphill) but a truck was going downhill (in his lane). The lorry driver tried to stop, I even saw the smoke in the wheels but it was too late. It hit our van and we almost fall into the valley.
Fortunatelly, only one of my friends had some small cuts because of the window glass and I have a big swollen circle with a bruise on my leg starting to show. 
The driver stopped another tourist van that offered to take us to the Tour company office. It was raining and the traffic became cahotic so honestly we just wanted to go away.
Around 300m later there was another accident. A big lorry fell into the valley and we believe that accident was due to ours, because after our crush the traffic stopped moving.
Finally this driver that helped us called our company and we met one member of the staff at the center where he was waiting us with a different car (a small one) and driver. He smiled the whole time, saying that it wasn¢®?t a big deal and that it was the lorry¢®?s driver fault. We couldn¢®?t believe it. We all are drivers and we saw perfectly what happened. He just said ¢®¡Æok I¢®?m sorry you can go to the airport if you want with him¢®¡¾, pointed out to the new driver.
We are ok but still in shock. I¢®?m sorry for such a long text but I just want to let you know that if you are looking for a Tour company in Kenya NEVER choose ¢®¡ÆAfrican Home Adventure¢®¡¾. In addition they charged me 23$ more when I payed the due balance at their office, saying that it¢®?s because their rate change is different (apart from the 6% charge for paying by card, which I find it normal). When I tried to explain them that my card (Revolut) make the payment according to the exchange rate of the day they refused, I didn¢®?t want to start our tour arguing so we didn¢®?t reply and we payed.
By the way, I¢®?ve seen they have great coments from a man called Abednegoh, he works for them. He was the one who was laughing while we were telling him that we almost die, and the one who texted me through WhatsApp a few days prior my trip which present I would bring him from my country.
There are hundreds of good and reliable safari and tours companies in Kenya but this one is not one of them."
Mar?a Marta Viana,AE,Visited: June 2019,19-Jun-19,50-65,first safari,E-Trip Africa,1,Very bad experience,"We hired their service for people over 50 to climb Kilimanjaro on the Lemosho route. From the beginning the guides were annoyed because were not fast enough for their expectations. They gave us no kind of support and even treated us condescending. We made the claim to the company but they didn't give us any answers. In short , if you are over 50, forget about this company"
Mar?a Paz Venegas,CL,Visited: November 2023,26-Nov-23,35-50,2-5 safaris,South Africa,2,Dissapointing,"The experience in Kruger Park was ok but not how we expected, we didnt saw too many animals. We think that our guide wasnt good, he drive for the same part of the park most of the time, we spend our without seeing animals.

We didnt saw any cheetas, leopards and Rhinos. The thing is that most of the time you can see them there, so we think that our guide wasnt good.  We¢®?ve been in Tanzania but there is another thing, we really enjoy there, the parks, the tour guide and we saw a lot of animals. 

We noticed that many people that pay a lot in the private reserve they has more chances to see animals and different species, I dont know if that a point to consider because they own a lot of animals , and the know exactlu where they are, but is very expensive too. Or maybe the option to drive by yourself could bebetter because you can go everywhere.. 

Also the communication during the tour with the agency wasnt good (Shinzelle Safaris).

We regret to add Kruger Park in our trip to Africa, that money could  worth it, in another place, because we visited Tanzania and Uganda and everything there was amazing. "
Marc,UK,Visited: January 2017,15-Feb-17,50-65,2-5 safaris,Lobo Safaris ltd,2,Unfriendly and unprofessional people : very bad communication and they are just a reseller.,"While the content of the safari (4 days/3 nights) was good, as for the driver and for the accommodations and food, I want to make following remarks :
-Lobo Safaris (part of Vimic  group) does not organize itself the safari.  The safari itself was done by Sandland Tours
-The start was disastrous (day before start of the safari) :
   - There were 2 different taxidrivers waiting for us at the airport of Arusha !!!
   - We were dropped in an hotel outside Arusha (Mercury hotel) in the middle of local habitations and no decent road, and in front of a local discotheque (noise at night) !
   - While the driver told us that Lobo safaris would contact us the same afternoon, we didn¢®?t hear anything from them until the morning after. Meaning we spent an whole afternoon, waiting in a desolate hotel (there was only another African couple as client of the hotel).
   - Also the payment was not what we expected we had to pay cash, while Lobo and Vimic  group advertise that they accept credit cards.
-The safari itself was good. Good driver/guide Simon and good accomodation. The program was not followed but this was not a problem (Tarangire in place of Lake Manyara).  Only the vehicle was in bad condition (old vehicle from 1996 front lights not working, no hand brake, starter not always working and a lot of dust entering the cabin)

Marc Bonnevie,AE,Visited: November 2016,01-Dec-16,50-65,over 5 safaris,Tembea East Africa Safaris,1,"Please, do not go on safari with Tembea East Africa Safaris !","We ( a party of 4 ) went on a Tanzanian safari with them out of Arusha.
They seemed reliable, as they were also appearing on Safari Bookings.  But what a mistake I made !

When requiring information and quotation, Evangelina, reservations staff, was extremely helpfull and replied by email always within the hour. I did some research, so I gave her the names of hotels / lodges I would stay in ( Arusha - Tarangire - Lake Manyara - Ngorongoro ).  She also quoted me the price of this week safari in "" all-in formula "".  I specifically asked her if this would include all drinks in the lodges ( whether alcoholic or not ) and she replied me yes !

When making the reservation, I had to pay a 60 % deposit.  I did this by bank transfer.  Damian, the accounting staff, was very eager to get the money, as he wrote me already the next day where the money was. I told him to be patient, since it takes a while before a bank transfer is done between Belgium and Kenya.  After 4 days he got the money.  Suddenly, he asked Evangelina by email ( with a copy to me ! ) if she granted me the usual discount.  Seemed, that by paying the balance 6 months before the trip ( instead of paying cash upon arrival ), I could get a 3 % discount.  Of course, this was a trap !!

Upon arrival in Arusha, Mr Issa ( the manager of Tembea ) was there at the hotel in order to collect the balance. He tried to switch my first lodge at Tarangire into a campsite, but I refused. 

First day ( a visit of Arusha National Park ) everything went well.  Comfortable jeep, excellent driver who gave us a very good explanation with spectacular binoculars.  At the end of that day, we made an appointment with him for the next day, when we would leave Arusha together for the one week safari.    

Next day... nobody came at the agreed time.  More than 2 hours later, a wreck of a jeep arrived, with another driver, who's english was very poor and difficult to understand.  He also had binoculars ( when I specifically asked for ) but they did not work !!
With this wreck of a jeep we went on safari.  From day one, a warning light was appearing on the dashboard, that the oil level of the brakes was too low. Twice we had a big mechanical problem and had to go to a local garage for a while.  The worst mechanical issue was that on the last day, decending from the Ngorongoro Rim to Karatu, we had NO brakes at all for 30 km !! A horrific experience !! 

Also, in the contract, they allowed us to go twice into Lake Manyara.  But once there, this was refused and only one entry was paid for.  The driver would have liked that we would be back in Arusha before lunch, instead of dinner, so to cut our safari by half a day.  But this I refused of course. 

Besides this, all lodges refused the all-in formula.  When I contacted Mr Issa, he said to keep all the receipts and that he'd reimburse me at the end of the trip, back in Arusha.  Guess who didn't show up ?  He was stopped at the Kenyan border ( he said ) ?!?!

I later on emailed all the receipts to Damian, and he replied me every two weeks, that the refund will be done.
Guess what ?  Nothing of all this happened of course !

When asking Mr Issa and Mrs Evangelina some explanations about this trip, no reply came.

They obviously are only after your money.  They do not care about customer service at all.  They only cheat, lie and mislead you !    

Hopefully this will help you to have a wonderfull safari, as Tanzania is amazing !

We (a party of three) agreed to a safari itinerary via email communication and paid in advance, all inclusive. When we went on the safari, Victor called and asked if I could please pay for park entry fees. He promised to reimburse me once we got back to Arusha. Now the problem is that the drivers do not have funds for the park entry fees so you have no other option than to pay or not enter the park. Of course, he does not refund your additional expenses.

On our trip we had two vehicles on the tour, one for the three of us (a couple and an individual) and the other for a family. Long story short, he played the parties against each other, for park admission, hotel accommodation upgrades, etc. Each of us got taken for $600, for a total of $1800. The other family actually ended up missing their flight for a trip to Zanzibar!! When confronted, Victor claimed he would reimburse us all. We suspected, however, that being thousands of miles away in the US, we would never see that money. 

It¢®?s been 10 months since our safari. He stopped responding to my emails and we¢®?ve never been reimbursed. I couldn¢®?t make a claim against my credit card, as I didn¢®?t pay Victor as part of the tour, but paid for entry directly to a park.

Victor is not a member of Tanzania Tour Operators Association. Make sure your tour operator is part of this organization. This essentially means that they are not able to help any customers who might have problems with Victor. Another reason for staying completely clear of this guy."

The guide took the money from them, but when we asked him about the price decrease (returning us some money) the next day he started to make excuses, eventually telling us to write to the office. So we did and the office assured us the guide will return the money after they talk to him. Eventually, the guide ran away after he left us in our hotel, avoiding confrontation and not giving us the money back. The office was not willing to help us with the situation.

The tour itself was good and we can't complain about it, but the situation with the guide and the office ruined the experience for us."

I was in Kenya with my family and we wanted to do the safari trip in masai mara so we were searching for any tour company doing that then we contacted blue mountain.
From my heart I regret it so much because of many things.
1- We were 4 ( My parents, my brother and me)  they told us we will have 2 tents each has 2 beds to stay then we reached there we realized that they were lying and they gave us just one tent of 4 beds then I called them that it was not our agreement so they said we don't have 2 tents as they told us and that is what available but they will give us 2 tents for the second night then for the second night nothing changed as I was expecting and we again stayed in the same tent of 4 beds.
2- We agreed with them that they will give us 3 boxes of water during our safari as one box for each day, In the first day the driver gave us one box and he told me that is all the water for you in the 3 days and I told him but we agreed for 3 boxes not 1 then I called again the office so they said we will give you another box as I was begging from them and it is not my right and I didn't call them they wouldn't give us the second box and they gave us after 3 times calling and after spoiling our vacation just 2 and half boxes not 3 as we agreed.
3- In the third day the driver told us we will not enter the park and we will go after the breakfast direct to Nairobi then I asked him how because we are supposed to enter the park 3 times in 3 days and he told me no then I called again the office ( may be it was the tenth or eleventh time to call them just in 48 hrs) and they told me no you will enter the park then again the driver he told me that we will enter but there is no time as less than 30 minutes in the park and it is nothing of course for the game drive then we didn't of course.
All of that made me so pissed off. 
So I went to their office on the next day of the safari and I was talking to them more than 2 hrs and they didn't give me anything even they didn't say sorry for that and the manager of the company told me go away from here you are such a liar !!!! 
 Imagine they are calling their customers as liars because we were asking for our rights.
I told him I will write about it he told me go away from here and write what you want we don't care ( ZERO CUSTOMER CARE) as they took already their money so they don't care anymore.
I will keep posting that times and times 
I don't recommend it to anyone to deal with them

The Owner  changed the accommodation for our Tarangire stay (Tarangire Ndovu tented lodge) at the last minute without consulting me. The matter and the way he dealt with it is in itself unacceptable, but most importantly the lodge we were given (Acacia Tarangire camp) is for sure of lower standard than the one we had chosen in terms of location, room quality and common areas. 

Moreover the lodge was more than one hour further south, which meant longer trip from Tarangire to Amboseli Park.

2) The jeep we have been using was very old and had several issues, including:
- some blocked windows
- extremely dirty
- the engine starter didn't work always and our guide had to ask for help from other cars several times in order to restart the car. We were lucky if we did not have major issues but this is a serious safety issue.

3) No binoculars were provided - the guide simply said it was broken.

It was my expensive and pointless sport in my life - walk to Mandara Hut. 380 dollars (for 2 persons) for bringing you to a place from where you can not see anything beautiful. 
The terrible experience began when it was time to start a new day with new adventures. We got up early in the morning to have breakfast before Kili Holidays arriving to the hotel to pick-up us. They arrived instead of the time (at 7:00) with an hour's delay (at 8:00), and only when they were called. There were 3 men in the car: a driver, a guide and a person who was collecting money. Nothing was arranged. We all went out to lunch boxes. It was only then that the journey began (from Arusha for more than two hours until Mandarin trail).
When we get there, a guide was no money to pay for the entrance. I need to pay this, although it was included in the price (we get back money when we arrive, but it shows the attitude). Upon starting the route, the guide said that we could not get up to the end, because we had to be back in time (although they were the ones who delayed). We went up to Mandara Hut, because we climbed quickly (there's nothing to see).  The guide does not even lead us to the magnificent waterfall 200 meters from Route (the Mandara waterfall). I only noticed this when we returned (watching a photo on the Internet).
On the way home, I heard that the guide told the driver about the company and then I understood that none of them was working at Kiliholidays. They have been taken from the edge at the last minute. 
Upon returning to hotel, a man who at start of the day charged money from us, was waiting us. (To make sure about how we liked, but in reality - he did not care. He thought he would get some tip, or something). 

No one spoke to us either during the trip or during the climb.
We paid a lot of money just to be able to climb the beautiful trail and see and find out exactly nothing.
This company is badly organized.

Maria,CA,Visited: October 2019,06-Nov-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Safari Multiways,2,A poor and frustrating experience!,"My honest review of my experience with Safari Multiways.

I was a Canadian long-term volunteer in Moshi, Tanzania. My husband was coming to visit me from Canada so I started to research budget-friendly options for a 4D3N private safari in the northern circuit. I stumbled upon Safari (SM) Multiways as per a recommendation from a board discussion on Tripadvisor; of all the recommended companies it was SM that provided me with the most economical quote. SM does not have an account on Tripadvisor so I instead gathered information from Tripadvisor forums and safaribookings.com. The consensus was that SM is a excellent tour company that you can count on to be reliable, professional, and give you the most bang for your buck. 

I was in contact with Victor during the planning stages. Victor immediately left a great impression as he was very professional, pleasant and responsive. The planning experience instilled my confidence and affirmed the great reviews left by hundreds of past clients. Unfortunately, our excitement and confidence was short-lived.

Our itinerary was as follows2 days in the Serengeti, 1 day in the Ngorogoro Crater, and 1 day in TP where we could journey home that very afternoon.

SM arranged to pick us up from Moshi at 7:00am to head to Serengeti central. It wasn¢®?t until the day before our safari that Victor suggested we instead stay in Arusha overnight to head to the Serengeti as it is a 6 hour journey from Arusha; if we travel from Moshi another 2 hours would be added to the commute. I wish he suggested this to me earlier so that we could¢®?ve made the necessary arrangements. We had an engagement the evening before the safari so there was no way for us to stay in Arusha the night before. This lack of communication/planning already left a bad taste in my mouth. 

We were picked up the next morning by our driver and tour guide, Pius. We knew beforehand that we were not signing up for a luxury vehicle, however, the car was very much dilapidated. Throughout the safari, a few things from the car kept falling off at a time. For example, the window frame (not sure what the technical term for this is) fell off, as well as the bumper ? which Pius needed to buy rope to secure back to the car. The seatbelt for one the front seats (which we preferred to sit in as we got a better view being closer to the dashboard) did not work; this is a safety hazard. There were no headrests so we woke up with headaches/neckaches every time we fell asleep during the commutes. Even worse, the car doors did not lock. So, whenever we had to leave the car to eat or use the washroom (with Pius included), I was relying on the good graces of the Lord to ensure no one tried to steal anything from the car. This is unacceptable.

On our way to the Serengeti, Pius asked if we had a lunch box. I don¢®?t know what gave SM the impression that we¢®?d have a lunch box with us as we were being picked up from home, not a hotel. Pius had to stop in Arusha to grab lunch boxes for us ? adding 30min to an already long, 8-hour commute to the Serengeti. We arrived in the Serengeti around 4pm. What was supposed to be a 4-hour game drive in the Serengeti (according to the itinerary sent by Victor) turned into a 1-hour game drive as we were dropped to our camp by 5:30pm.

We enjoyed our second day in the Serengeti and Pius worked hard to ensure we saw all the animals we wanted to see. I can say that he was friendly and kind; however, the more time we spent with him, we started to realize that he felt more like a driver than a guide. He knew the names of the animals and birds but did not know anything else beyond that. I wasn¢®?t expecting a national geographic commentary but he did not have any knowledge of basic things like their diet, or general information about their habitat. We were fortunate to see the critically endangered rhino through our binoculars, but when I asked Pius whether the black rhino can only be found in Tanzania or if it can be found in other countries as well, he did not know. 

The worst part of our trip happened while we were in the Ngorogoro crater. First off, we didn¢®?t reach the crater until 12pm. I was already worried about lack of time until I learned that the permits only allow 6-hour visits at a time. By 3pm, Pius explained that we saw all the animals we needed to see and there was not much else to see in the crater - and then suggested we head back to our lodge. I insisted that I would like to spend more time exploring the crater (considering we spent a lot of money on our permit) as we wanted to make the most of our time there. By 4pm he began to exit the crater. Therefore, we only explored the crater for 4 hours (1 hour lunch break included). After researching online, I learned that people usually use all 6 hours of their permit to explore the park. Halfway up the crater ascent the car engine seemed to stop working and we were stuck on an upwards slope. I was fearful that the car would break down completely and we would either fall off the ledge or slide backwards onto the vehicle parked behind us. While Pius was getting help from others around him, he did not explain what was happening but looked panicked. Some of the gentlemen helping had to put bricks behind the back tires so Pius didn¢®?t have to keep shifting gears to keep the car in neutral/park. After everything was resolved I was honest with Pius and shared that we did not appreciate not being informed of what was happening at the time. He advised that these issues are common in Tanzania ? but can be resolved easily ? which is why he didn¢®?t feel the need to explain, but profusely apologized ? which we really appreciated.

For our last day, our lunch boxes were forgotten at the lodge. This was really frustrating as we not only had to cut our time in short in TP in order to have lunch in town, but the value and amount of food in a packed lunch box is worth far more than the local restaurant lunch we ended up having in Karatu.

Once the safari ended, I was relieved. It was singlehandedly the most stressful and frustrating vacation I've experienced, and if I were to do it all again, I would not go with SM. In fact, I wish I could do it all again and experience the stunning national parks Tanzania has to offer the RIGHT way!  I understand that we went with the most affordable tour company, but when you spend well over two grand on an experience, you at least expect an acceptable level of standards. 

Although, our experience does not seem to be consistent with reviews of many happy clients of SM, the cynic in me found that most (if not all) of the clients¢®? reviews had Amos or Omari as their guide. I tried to look for reviews of Pius and he is mentioned as the ¢®¡Ædriver only¢®¡¾. Based on pure speculation, I¢®?m inclined to believe that SM may have been ¢®¡Ætesting the waters¢®¡¾ with the knowledge that I¢®?m a long-term volunteer and may not hold the same standards as the wealthy western tourists who often go on these safaris. I think we were given the bad end of the bargain (ie. a battered vehicle and a guide lacking in experience) perhaps as an experiment. 

On a more positive note, the accommodation SM chose for our mid-range budget needs were superb (Tukaone in the Serengeti and Eileen¢®?s Trees Inn in Karatu). Also, despite the lack of knowledge and experience, Pius was otherwise really sweet, and even bought red bananas and baobab fruit for us to try during the trip. 

With hundreds of TOs in Tanzania, word of mouth is often the most powerful tool for raising the profile of your company. But as it stands, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Safari Multiways to my large network of expat volunteers, friends, and family in Tanzania.

We had to ask the person in charge of our trip ( Caroline) to send us the name and details of our guide-driver because she hadn't done it and it was friday afternoon and our flight was departing Europe on Sunday. At that moment she told us the rules for Masai Mara had changed and even if we had paid extra to sleep inside the park the last night so as to do an early game drive, that wasn't possible unless we paid one extra entrance ticket. It was too late to cancel the lodge for another outside the park and cheaper. It was very anoying.
On the other hand the guide-driver: Nafthali, was speaking on his mobile very often, even when he was driving uphill and the road was wet!. And when we were watching animals he rarely explained anything, unless we asked heim for information, because he was chatting on the phone or with the whatsapp.
Of course, ones the trip ended, Mufasa did not request a feedback. They were aware of their poor service!!
As a conclussion, Mufasa did not reach our expectations and was not a good value for money."
Maria Nemethova,AT,Visited: October 2023,11-Nov-23,50-65,first safari,Kipok Africa Adventures,1,"unreliable, untrustworthy and careless","I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with my recent safari experience in Tanzania with Kipok Africa Adventures
I booked 3-day safari package for 2 people, including one airport transfer, transfers to and from accommodation before and after the safari, and full 3-day safari with guide and accommodation. 

Itinerary: 1.day Tarangire, 2.day Ngorongoro and 3.day Lake Manyara 
Contact person: Amani 

Specific Feedback
?	Communication: After we paid for our trip, we received very little communication from Kipok Adventures. We were not informed that we would be with a different group/company each day, even though we paid for a package that should have included the same guide for the entire trip. They also charged us extra for the airport transfer, which should be included in the price of our package.
?	Plan changes: The original safari plan included visiting Tarangire National Park on day one, Ngorongoro Crater National Park on day two, and Lake Manyara National Park on day three. At the last minute, we were informed that the plan was changing and we would be visiting Lake Manyara on day two and Ngorongoro Crater on day three. Due to these changes, on the second day of our safari, we had too much free time because we were very close to Lake Manyara, and on the last day, we had to rush through Ngorongoro Crater (the highlight of safari) in order to make it to Arusha on time. This made the trip feel rushed and stressful.
?	Guides: We had a different guide from a different company every day. We never knew for sure who would be leading us. For two days, the car had no company markings. The guide on the last day was very unprofessional and did not organize the taxi to our hotel properly. We had difficulty getting back to our hotel and had to ask the guide from the previous day, John from Crater Explorer Tours, for help. John was the only one responding and actually the only really professional guide on our trip. I am very grateful to him for helping us even though he was not our guide on the last day.
Additional Feedback
I would also like to add that I sent a complaint letter to Kipok Africa Adventures but I did not receive a response until few days later, after I sent a warning to write a review based on my experience. This is already 2 weeks and since then I did not hear from the company. I believe that this shows that Kipok is not serious about addressing customer complaints.
Conclusion
I am very disappointed with the service that I received from Kipok Africa Adventures. I would not recommend them to anyone.

We had very good time with our guide (who was not the supposed this one at first) and lodging and food were great. However the relationship with Chabo has not been really friendship. After 3 days our guide was still not there (fortunately the woman at our lodge in Selous was a wonderful person and guide) and they lied to us several time on the reason why. We finally understand that they had problems with the car. Chabo then rented a cheap open car (without seat belts) to take us from Selous to Mikumi that was not really adapted for the long drive to Mikumi. We finally met our guide at Mikumi rather than at Selous as first programmed. Later, without explanation either, they replaced a correct car, which we only kept for two days, with another car in quite poor condition. We realized also that our planing was not quite logical since it would have been less waste of time to go first to Udzungwa after Mikumu and not after Ruaha. Nevertheless we had a really great time because the parks in the South are all fantastic with not too many people, all the guides we had were great, professional, kind and helpful and because tanzanian people are really welcoming in general. Most of Chabo's good reviews are certainly deserved, but it would be a pity if the reputation they have built up over the years were to begin to fall apart through a certain lack of respect and consideration for customers."
Mario,SK,Visited: November 2023,03-Dec-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Trots & Safari Uganda,1,Not recommended at all.,"I am not sure if the other reviews are real about Trots and Safari operator. I have completly different experience with this company of my 3 days trip to Bwindi: 

1. They have been lying from the beggining. Edison was trying to convinced me (and in the end he did), that they are able to transfer us to lounge in Bwindi from Entebbe airport in 6-7 hours, even when google maps shows time 9-10 hours. Unfortunately I have believed them because of smooth communication and calls with Edison. We arrived at Entebbe airport at 3 pm. We get to the lounge after 12 hours of driving at 3 am next day. Even if we had a good car (look at point two in review), we can not make it in 6-7 hours. It is impossible. If I have knew that, I will never booked this trip. The night driving in the roads of Uganda are not safe at all, do not believed them, if they tell you it is safe! We drove 9 hours at night and have been scared to death.

2. Trots and Safari company has only one car-  this company car was broken after first 2 hours of the trip- actually first borken thing was our left front wheel. Took 2 hour to repair it. In total, car has been broken 3 times during our 3 days trip. Every time something different- wheel, engine, cables. It did not make it to the end. We get another 2 cars from insurance company, what was called to transfer us to the hotel. That car should have never been used for that kind of trip. Totally unprepaired and unsafe for trip. We had only luck, that it did not broke in night at Bwindi forest. During our trip we really felt unsafe and that ruined our trip.

3. We did not have any lunch box or dinner on our first day, Trots and Safari are selling this trip as a full board trip.

4. First night we slept 2 hours because we arrived at 3 am, instead of 8-9 pm like was planned by Edison (unreal even for google maps planning, I am ashamed, that that I have believed to this guy). We did trek to gorillas, permits cost 1400 dollars, and we have been too tired to even enjoyed it after 2 hours of sleeping. 

4. Our guide was Jimmy- he did everyting what he could. But he did not know even in what accommodation we sleep. And Edisons phone at night was turn off, when Jimmy was trying to reach him to ask, where we should sleep. 

5. In the end of trip I have asked for partial refund, they have stopped communicate with me. 

I would like to recommend to anybody, who wants to book trip with Trots, first think twice before booking, do not believed everything, what they are saying and be prepared, when you will arrived to the airport and you will give them rest of the money for the trip, they have stopped to being interested in service.

- Issues in communication. We asked Rewald to add one day for acclimatization, to increase our chances of summitting Kilimanjaro. He replied thumb up on our what's app group. When we arrived we realized he didn't add the 7th day. After reading many websites saying our chance to summit will increase if we spend 7 days on the mountain (5 up 2 down, we texted Rewald asking if we could add one day, he replied yes it will be $270 per person. We paid the extra day because our goal was to summit. After 2 days on Kilimanjaro our guide told us the extra day we paid was to go down, not to go up. We were so disappointed, what is the goal to add an extra day if not to go up and take our time to acclimate. We decided not to spend 3 days going down and asked for a refund minus the salary for the guides and porters. We didn't want the team to be penalized because of the issue in our communication with Rewald. After a long conversation Rewald refunded us $70 per person. So we paid $200 for a day we didn't do just because of poor communication. 

- one of the big scams on Kilimanjaro is the team adds a porter on the last day when it is time to pay the tips. We spent 6 days making sure we talked to all our team and learned the names of everyone. On the last day we were tired and when it was time to pay the tips the team sang and danced for us. While I was paying the tips I realized someone I didn't know was in the line of porters. I gave him money thinking I never saw this guy the last 6 days but I was not 100% sure so I gave him a tip (and I Trusted Baraka, our guide). We were missing one person for the tips. We were so confused and sorry for missing one so very quickly we grabbed more cash to pay an extra person. On the way back I was thinking how odd the situation was. I showed the photo of the misterious porter to the other porters asking his name and no one knew his name. When I showed to the guide, Baraka, he said it is Steve the cooks assistant but he left because he is going somewhere else tomorrow. Everyone was so uncomfortable and the energy changed. After googling we learned of the scam of the extra porters at the tips ceremony. Advice ask the name of all the team on the first day to make sure you have the same amount of people when you pay tips. 

- we paid to Rewald's friend $30 to get a sim card. Not sure if it was a good price but because we lost trust in him not sure we are not sure

- no oxygen or radio on the mountain. After talking to many guides they all told us we have oxygen and radios if anything happens. Better to ask before choosing your company to make sure you will be safe on the mountain.

I am mad and disappointed by Rewald Moshi and Baraka. We trusted them and they saw us as money on legs, nothing more. I am glad we didn't do the safari and other activities with them.

Mariusz Steckiewicz,VN,Visited: January 2020,06-Feb-20,35-50,first safari,Shemeji Safari Tanzania,1,Memorable safari with terrible ending,"We have booked a 7-day safari with Shemeji. It was our first trip to Africa and the first safari experience, therefore we didn't really know what to expect therefore decided to rely entirely on a local provider. We found Shemeji on the internet and it caught our attention because it had an excellent rating as well the offer matched to what we were looking for.
We believed an experienced service operator would know exactly what they were selling and would assume responsibility for the events happening during the trip. Well, it appeared we were wrong about it.

Firstly, we would like to shout huge thank you and express endless gratitude to the guide/driver Elemes and the chef Isaack, who did absolutely everything and more to make our trip comfortable and memorable. These two gentlemen service was 5-star throughout our entire tour. Always smiling and always helpful, they made our trip successful within all their capacity.

However, what made us give Shemeji 1 start is the company management approach to the problems we faced.
We had to pay 100% in advance, which is understandable but they added 5% to the price if the payment is by a credit card. This is not a standard procedure as in the hotel we were not charged extra to the card payment.
As mentioned earlier, we relied on the local operators, expecting them to know the situation better than us coming from another continent. 
Out trip didn't start very well, as the car was delayed on the first day already due to technical problems. The second day the car got stuck in the mud for over 2 hours on the campsite just before leaving for the safari drive. 
Not only our trip was again delayed but also a car of another couple whose staff was trying to help our driver.  The quality of the car we got was rather poor but we accepted it as we didn't mind the conform as long as the safety wouldn't be compromised. We trusted the company did treat the safety of their clients and the staff seriously.  
One part of our adventure was the visit to Lake Natron going from Serengeti. Due to the heavy rain, the roads and bridges were cut off and we were forced to turn back, which resulted in driving again through Serengeti. 
We did understand the weather unpredictability and followed the situation without complaints. However, later on, we have learned that Lake Natron, during the rain, is dangerous and we shouldn¢®?t go there. I would think a local company would know that during the rainy season rain comes rather frequently and either shouldn't include this point in their itinerary or would have advised us on the potential risk beforehand. But instead, they have sold the trip without any notice. 
Somewhere on the way, it happened that the car got a flat tire, which again we understood and didn't complain about it either. 

On our way back through Serengeti the car got seriously broken. Our rear wheel fell off. The same wheel as the one which got a flat tire a day or two earlier. This was a very scary situation as we were driving at quite high speed and we realized how lucky we were that the car didn't rollover.

This accident caused a very long time delay and we have lost an entire day of our planned trip waiting for another transportation to take us back to some accommodation, in addition to quite a traumatic experience of seeing our car's wheel rolling ahead of the car.
Later on, we have also learned that after the wheel was fixed and the car was on its returning way it had broken again, which made me doubt in the technical conditions of the car. Is the company truly investing in car maintenance and the clients' safety or is purely focused on sale and profit?

The last day was entirely lost and the next day was too short to fill it with what we have in our plans.  We had to return to the campsite and just spent last night in the same place we started, which was not according to our purchased package. The company offered a visit to Maasai Village, which was the only option to do, even though it was not of our interest initially.

We were never demanding and stayed the entire trip very understanding, knowing that the weather conditions cannot be planned, however, the plans we badly affected and we expected the company to take responsibility for the trip they have sold and at least correct the price according to what we have received.
To our surprise Emma, one of the owners (according to our understanding) rejected all the claims, stating that they did us a favor not requesting us to pay extra for the park fees which we had to drive again through, pushing all the responsibility to the weather conditions. 

We were also told that the operator had to pay the accommodation booking fees in advance, even though we have found out that the accommodation places and the tour operator belong to the same corporate group.  
This was a very disappointing end of our trip. 

From 7 days safari that we paid for, we have received actually not even full 6 days. We experience a very dangerous incident and we were left with the impression that we should be grateful that we were not requested to pay extra. This was not what we have imagined from a professional, 5-star rated tour operator. 
The safari was great and the guide and the chef service was top notch but if you consider buying a service from Shemeji you may think twice and pay for everything in advance regardless what the trip brings, as you will be charged and given responsibility for everything that happens during your trip."
Mark,CZ,Visited: February 2019,28-Mar-19,50-65,first safari,Lians Travel Africa,1,"Terrible woman, very rude, non professional, stole our money, left us stranded","Dear reader, as you read this, please scroll to the review under this one. March 4th, a 5 star review of a ten-day safari with one picture of like 2 buffaloes, March 2nd, two days earlier, a one star review, might not seem odd. February 24th, one star review, followed two days by well what do you know, a five star review. From August 2018 to February 24th, zero reviews.And after two one star reviews, 2 days later a 5 star review shows up? The reason I¢®?m pointing this is out is what I have to say about Lians Travel Africa. We met Lilian, the owner of Lians Travel in our estate, who had just arrived with the driver. They were slightly later than expected but nevertheless we were happy that they had come, we left and had to go to the bank to pay the driver presumably. This was on 11th February, long drive, thought we were stopping for lunch in a town called Narok but apparently after clients pay for all inclusive, they also pay for their own lunch. (I have the text message provided to me from Lilian¢®?s confirmed number, check even on Lians Travel Africa at the bottom and see the Mobile phone number ending in 710 111. One passenger was sick but poor her, she didn¢®?t even get lunch, priority was to get her to camp to relax. We saw the Maasai performance which was nice, safari on 12th was very nice too, it was a pleasant day and I can¢®?t complain. 
13th February was went it all went bad. We had no safari in the morning and I saw the itinerary and noticed a few issues that the driver had pointed out. I will mention these later. The driver was looking nervous and was talking to my daughter and her husband. We were just standing on the side of the road, not knowing what¢®?s going on. A few phone calls in the car, messages exchanged, my daughter and her husband were getting concerned and from what they told me, the driver didn¢®?t wanna go on the journey, it seems that driver was not paid his full money. We didn¢®?t really know that but I just wanted to continue with the journey.

My daughter called this woman, her husband did too, the driver and at some point it was just shouting and shouting even when they told her to calm down. The woman called Lilian. From what I have been told, she accused my daughter¢®?s husband of being on the same side as the driver who were apparently running the safari. I have the message to prove it. It¢®?s funny because my son in law also paid for this safari so I didn¢®?t understand why she accused him. Later he explained that Lilian sent a text message saying that ¢®¡ÆYou are from Kikuyu tribe so I know you also stole something from the safari.¢®¡¾ Kikuyu tribe is one of the biggest tribes in Kenya and apparently the stereotype is that Kikuyus love money and Lilian was by a long shot, trying to say that my daughter¢®?s husband was stealing from us too. I think she thought that he was some travel agent who booked the holiday for us, in Europe we are not saying this to people, I just don¢®?t understand why she said it. What kind of person is this or what kind of country is it where someone judges another by tribal basis? I really didn¢®?t understand this. I will attach this message here and you will see with your own eyes. It¢®?s unbelievable that after ditching us in Narok, she was trying to secretly find out if we paid the park fees for ourselves, hello? She had just ditched us a few hours earlier! Anyway,I¢®?ve got a video of her telling us to ¢®¡Æsort ourselves out¢®¡¾, it¢®?s a shame I cannot post it here, but IF YOU ARE READING THIS,JUST GOOGLE LIANS TRAVEL and you will see even on YouTube.There is just something terrible about seeing your loved ones and family members looking despondent, it really gets you. it was very bad day, everyone frustrated, poor safari and we had to pay for transport and entrance for Nakuru. A police report was made but I understand that Lilian just hid from the authorities, no justice in Africa. It was a terrible experience for my family and my first time in Africa. You have seen the suspicious reviews here, and on no other platform will you find Lians Travel Africa, just on safari bookings, that should be your first red flag. Check the top of my post and see the reviews from August 2018 to now, see if they make any sense, 2 days after this, another 5 star review might show up. Since 4th March, no review yet, strange indeed. I shall attach the text messages here as proof. 

I will give some advice too, there are many good travel companies, with good reviews all over the internet, much more trustworthy, do you wanna risk it with this company? I¢®?m sure you don¢®?t. I don¢®?t recommend this company at all!"

Mark,VN,Visited: September 2015,12-Nov-15,20-35,first safari,Somak Holidays,2,Rather poor,"Quick answer to the mails, friendly and helpful office staff. After booking and paying the contact ends, besides a voucher sent to you about 2-3 weeks before travel. At least a follow-up mail confirming flight details etc. one week before departure would be a nice move.

Pick up and transfer to ole sereni hotel worked well. However they charged me over 300 USD for that one night. On the website I found afterwards prices between 180-220 Dollars for a night. That`s what I call a rip off, especially after paying a couple of thousands for a 8-day safari.

The 8-day cheetah safari: Generally confortable lodges and camps. Unfortunately the downside was our driver, he spent a lot of time on the phone taking personal calls - even during game drives!!!- very unmotivated just doing his job. Did not stop at different amazing sights like baby giraffes right next to our car. Everyone in our group was quite frustrated about this. Sometimes we had to intervene and demanded a stop."
Mark C.,UK,Visited: September 2012,29-Oct-13,50-65,first safari,Wildlife Safaris (Pty) Ltd,2,"Kruger Park is amazing, however the contractor that supplied the open vehicles needs to be changed.","Our Safari in Kruger had a rough start, on the first official game drive ( late afternoon, with the open safari vehicle ) the vehicle broke down. When our driver/guide stopped to view animals, the vehicle refused to start. After soliciting the assistance of a passerby who had mechanic tools and knowledge, we returned to the camp safely and finished the game drive in a mini van.

The following day on our early morning game drive ( different open safari vehicle) we again broke down. This time a much greater distance from the camp and outside of cell phone range. We had to wait approx. 2 hours in the hot morning sun until another Safari company stopped and assisted in contacting the camp to arrange for alternate transportation. In the end we agreed to continue with the game drive, in another vehicle . However as a whole we were concerned for our overall safety with these vehicles and we had lost faith and trust in this tour company to deliver a product as agreed upon"

Once we got to Zanzibar, all communications ceased, leaving us to arrange and pay for meals, drinks, outings, transfers and flights, which were supposedly included. Very disappointing. Only redeeming feature was Michael the guide who was a star."
Markus,DE,Visited: July 2019,24-Aug-20,50-65,over 5 safaris,Gatatu Safaris,1,"WARNING! $ 14,000 fraud and embezzlement","Almost a year in advance, we had booked an almost three-week safari via GATATU for five people in July / August 2019. The trip should cost a total of around 35,500 US dollars. As agreed, US $ 20,000 were transferred in advance. The rest should be handed over on site.
 
We were promised 2 safari vehicles, which should accompany us on the almost three-week tour, when we arrived at the airport there was only an old and neglected mini-bus that picked us up at the airport in Kigali in the late evening and then did not pick us up agreed boutique hotel but moved to another hotel.
After long discussions I was able to convince the otherwise very nice driver to take us to the agreed boutique hotel. We couldn't reach Richard, the manager of GATATU.

The next day we met the manager Richard in the office of GATATU Safaris in Kabale. It turned out there that not a single one of the agreed lodges was reserved. Richard received from us $ 1,500 for a 5th Gorilla Permit.

Since the owner of the first lodge warned us not to give Richard more money, we agreed that I would pay for all the lodges within the next three weeks on site and use the remaining US $ 14,000 for it.

The next evening it turned out that everything else was not paid for, e.g. the chimpanzee permits, entry to the national parks, accommodation and food for the driver, fuel, costs for the rented minibus etc. etc.

Of the 21,500 US dollars that GATATU received from us, only 7,500 US dollars were used for the gorilla permits, the rest (14,000 US dollars) was pocketed by the manager for no consideration. Richard could not be reached by phone, so on the third day we had to file a report with the tourism police in Kabale.

Richard was on the run, arrested three weeks later and jailed for three weeks. With one of his representatives, who visited us together with a senior officer, we agreed that Richard would repay the embezzled money in payment installments, which has not yet happened. At this point I do not want to report anything about our very negative experiences with the police in Uganda.

I can only warn you strongly against making any deals and especially advance payments to GATATU.

Markus,DE,Visited: October 2023,04-Nov-23,20-35,over 5 safaris,Kennafrica Adventures,2,Beware of rip-offs,"I booked a seven day safari with Kennafrica Adventures, which included the Masai Mara, Lake Nakuru, and Amboseli. The expos? was excellent, and the tour was slightly more expensive than comparable tours, which would have been absolutely fine considering the services promised. 
Unfortunately, the stated inclusive services were not provided. 
For example, a walking safari at night, a visit to a Masai village, a photography workshop, a visit to an elephant sanctuary, or cheetah tracking on foot, to name but a few. 
The tour was ultimately carried out by a third-party provider (I would give this provider at least four stars). 
What is particularly annoying here, however, is that this provider was (initially) not paid. Kennafrica Safaris was then suddenly no longer available by phone or otherwise, so I first had to advance money to the subcontractor in order to continue with the safari. Only after many (unanswered) phone calls and threats with lawyers, the police and the Ministry of Tourism was the corresponding fee finally paid, 770 dollars. I myself had paid 1200 dollars. The considerable difference might in my view be explained by the omission of services that were promised but not provided. All in all, a very disappointing experience and so different from all the hospitality that one usually experience throughout Kenya.
Finally, I can absolutely recommend the route itself, especially the Masai Mara, and also our driver Evans did a great job.

To be fair, they have apologized for all the inconvenience, but I personally would not book with them again."

My wife and I travel a lot. Whenever possible we try to use local travel agencies to spend the money locally. This is what we did for our 2-week trip to Ruanda in January 2023. Mandrill African Safaris put together a great trip ticking all our boxes. Sam, our guide, was a very pleasant and helpful young man. He looked after us very well. It was all the more annoying and frustrating that we were told while doing our Gorilla trekking that the company could not draw money from its accounts due to some administrative hiccup and we should pay for petrol, park fees etc. as our guide could not draw the money to do so. We would be refunded at the end of the trip. Knowing Africa, we refused to do this but it quickly seemed as if our only chance to get back to Kigali and our flight home, was to pay an extra $500.- on top of our original fee of $11000.-. Needless to say that we never saw the money again and got nothing but a load of excuses. The whole thing is really sad as we would have liked to recommend Mandrill African Safaris to our friends due to the great tour we had otherwise. This way we can only say: BEWARE or be cheated!

The only positive thing that has happened with this agency was that we had Aruni the first three days as a driver (he was 10/10). But, since the beginning, the programme you are supposed to follow is not followed at all, and they skip several game drives during those 10 days. Our big problem with the agency began when we arrived to Tanzania and we tried to contact to the agency because again they were skiping the morning game drive at Manyara Lake. Although at the beginning they answered back, they did not give me any solution, and that same day they did not amswered until now. They were supposed to provide me a transfer to Kilimanjaro Airport the last day (paying 40 dolar). I messeged them by WhatsApp to see if finally they will provide it or not. They did not answered. I asked then the Tanzanian agency with which they cooperate and the said that they will arrange the transfer for the airport for me. Suddenly, when I was expecting to pay for that transfer, our guide and driver at Tanzania, Joseph, said that his boss wanted to talk to me by the mobile. His boss told me that Karibu would aford the payment of the transfer to the airport, although personal of Karibu did not inform me about that by WhatsApp. They were supposed to pick us up at 4:30 am. Noone appeared at the hotel. At 4:45 am we calles  for a taxi. I have contacte to the hotel once we have arrived to Zanzibar and they have confirmed that no driver went to the hotel.

- we were charged for tickets which never been paid ( company is cooperating on the side with gate keepers) however we received our game driver.The feeling we've been tricked was painful.Lies in your face. Plus was the food and they were on time with schedule.

He was mainly interested in the radio chatter (I know that is how the guides pass on information when they spot an animal, but he never turned the radio off).   When we asked him to turn the radio off so we could hear the animals in the Serengeti, he did not speak to us again.  I believe he should be moved to a different position with the company.

He never faced the consequences opposite to the quantity of problems that we had: it gave to us a torn land cruiser and left wire drawing us in the desert of the Kalahari for hours. It took us show restraint, breakfasts and dinners that were included in the trip. It gave to us camps that were not the approved ones (some without water). It took us games drives in spite of having paid them. It made pay the income to a companion to the park Chobe because he said to us that it forgot to do it and to never return the money to us.

The tour guide was great and very knowledgeable, however, the owner of the company, Calvin, is unfortunately very dishonest. He claimed the government was responsible for putting us on the wrong campground and that he could only refund us once the government had refunded him.
We doubt this is true as the tour guide was paying all accommodation in cash and had even picked up equipment for the public camp site. It is very clear the plan was to let us stay in the public camp site from the time we left Arusha. 

Calvin has promised a partial refund but has to this date (10 months after the tour) not made any efforts to refund us .

We did not get picked up eventually. We have waited for an entire hour at the pick up spot, but we never saw the guide coming. In desperation, we tried to contact the company through all possible means -- WhatsApp, email, calling their number, and even trying to search for more contact information. All the call numbers cannot be reached, and no reply from the WhatsApp and email whatsoever.

We ended up losing all hope and ran to the town, booking another company in last minute.

We got contacted 3 hours later via WhatsApp, and we were told that the phone of the contact person has been stolen and thus the events that occurred. By then we already agreed to take an offer from another company. We were also very disappointed by the explanation, since we doubted whether it is entirely impossible to inform us via email, something that can be accessed with any laptop computer.

Max,US,Visited: August 2022,14-Aug-22,20-35,first safari,Hyrax Safaris,1,Hyrax Safari functions as a middle man in Tanzania,"Hyrax is not a real tour operator for Tanzania. 

Roselyne, who runs Hyrax, was recommended to me by a safari guide my friend used. I booked a 4 day safari and a Kilimanjaro trek with her. 

She quoted me $1000 for a safari. I paid her a deposit of $300 and, upon arrival to Arusha, I paid another $700 in person to a tour operator of a different name (strange right?).

During my safari of the past 4 days, I learned that everyone else on the trip paid $650 to a different company (instead of the $1000 I paid to Hyrax). I pointed this out to Hyrax and explained that I wished to be paid the $350 I was up charged. Roselyne said that we should no longer conduct business if I feel I was cheated and cancelled my Kilimanjaro trek that was supposed to start tomorrow. 

The Kilimanjaro trek was quoted at $1700 ($200 as a deposit and $1500 once I arrived here in Tanzania). She kept my $200 Kilimanjaro deposit and would have kept the $1500 I had en route (had I not deactivated my visa).

Moral of the story: 
-Hyrax is not a real tour operator in Tanzania (they are in Nairobi I believe). They place you on trips with existing operators out of Arusha and then charge you hundreds of dollars more than local companies you could have just booked directly with. 

-If you notify Hyrax of the upcharge and complain about them secretly acting as a middle man, then you could get the rest of your trip cancelled and your security deposit stolen like I did. 

-Tanzania is a wonderful place to visit and my safari over the past 4 days was incredible; just book with a real company in the area for a cheaper rate. 

Disclaimer: Roselyne did un-cancel my trip hours after doing so (and likely after realizing I cancelled that $1500 bank transfer she could have stolen). By that time I had already found another company to go with. "
Max,DE,Visited: August 2023,20-Aug-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Kenya Bush Expeditions,2,Good guide but contracts not honored,"I booked a tour (2 days Safari Maasai Mara). Did the 50% prepayment.
One day the company owner contacted me telling me that park fees got raised and that he wants me to top up my fee about another 80USD per person.
I told him out of generiosity, that I can take over 50% of the increased fees, because thats his business risk and not mine (and package+price was already negotioated).
He declined and didnt even try to find a good solution here, just wanted me to take the whole fee. As client paying hundreds of Dollars for that tour already, that behaviour just felt really wrong and ""greedy"".
So just wanted to warn you that if you book with that agency, you might end up paying for additional stuff that was not negotiated (maybe he will also charge you for inceased gas prices, who knows.)

Tour itself was good. We had a great guide. Just be careful with your prepayment. Cheers"
Meg,UK,Visited: September 2022,01-Oct-22,20-35,first safari,Kenya,2,Amzing wildlife,"I enjoyed my trip, but there are few things I must say.
Safaris are overbooked. We had 10 people in the van ( including driver). For people sitting in the back or front sit (next to the driver) it was difficult to enjoy the experience. It was too crowded, sometimes I couldn't even turn or stand up for the view. Missed quite a lot because of that. Bare in mind people in the van won't just let you see.They want to enjoy as well and they won't just sit and say 'your turn now'. Vans should be bigger or less crowded. 
People here will give you a price after looking at you and judging how much money you have. Prices are visible only in supermarkets.
Be careful what you buy. Souvenirs often contain bone, skin or plant fragments that are illegal to bring back home. 
If you decide to stay in Nairoibi, avoid city centre. It's overcrowded, easy to get mugged. I alsao have beed sexually harrased and called names for no reason. Racist.
Rubbish everywhere. It was heartbreaking to see so much plastic and other stuff along the road. Very bad for environment.
Avoid raw fruits and vegetables, eat only what's been cooked. You never know what kind of water they used to wash. 
Food was often cold. We stopped for lunches on our way from one park to another and never had a hot meal. Easy to get food poisoning.
Be prepared to spend a lot of money for tipping people. Every little thing they do for you they will expect you to tip them, some will even tell you how much.
On the good side wildlife is amazing.
You see the same animal many times and still don't have enough.
Most of the parks are really big. You just keep driving.
I liked the fact that they are kept as natural as possible (no modern roads, few stops with actual toilets etc.) Gives you real wild experience. "
Melanie,CA,Visited: August 2022,12-Sep-22,35-50,first safari,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Budget should not mean poor quality....,"We read many reviews of various companies and chose Karibu because they seemed to offer a very professional service, they guaranteed maximum 6 people maximum per van (so everyone has a window seat) and apparently had good guides (so many reviews said the driver/guides were excellent!). We chose a 7 day safari to Maasai Marai, Lake Naivasha, Hell¢®?s Gate, Lake Nakuru and Amboseli. Unfortunately, we were somewhat disappointed. 

Booking, communication with Robert, payment and initial pick-up all went smoothly! Yay! But then¢®?things started taking a downward turn¢®?first, we were told that the planned itinerary was changing because we had 4 people joining us later¢®?no worries. This change ultimately meant we spent more time in the car (so less time doing activities) and almost 2 hours waiting for the people to join. During that first day¢®?s amended agenda, we went to Hell¢®?s Gate park. Our driver/guide Castro kept telling us we needed to rent bikes and that he could not drive in the park¢®?he pretty much dropped us off to negotiate bike prices on our own, it was a rather uncomfortable situation (which quite honestly should have pre-arranged or the negotiating done by him¢®?the guide). Being new to Kenya we had no idea what would have been a reasonable price. Anyhow, we took bikes and rode into the park with a different guide who was assigned to us without any previous explanation. We did love the experience of riding the bikes, but it became obvious that our driver had not been fully honest with us as there were many groups driving through the park and disembarking for photo opportunities. Let¢®?s just say that this first bit of ¢®¡Ædishonesty¢®¡¾ did not set us up for a relationship of confidence with our guide. Many little things like this kept happening along the way and it just made us uncomfortable and even frustrated at times. In fact, on more than one occasion, so-called ¢®¡Æoptional¢®¡¾ activities were assigned to us without choice nor with any prior information and then the person providing that activity would expect some sort of extra payment, which we were never made aware of before.

That first night we were driven to a hotel that was not in the planning that was sent to us by Robert and when we asked about it, Castro said that the other hotel had called him to say they were fully booked and that we should go to this one. Again¢®?seemed strange but, whatever, we went with the flow. A similar thing happened to us in Maasai Mara when we arrived at a different camp than what was on the planning. Since there were now 6 in our group at this point, everyone questioned the situation and Castro just seemed annoyed with us. He did not exhibit any sort of patience and eventually, in a huff, drove us off to the other camp at which apparently no reservation had been made and we were again put in an uncomfortable situation¢®?.we were told by the camp staff that the only tents available were ¢®¡Æluxury¢®¡¾ tents and that we would have to pay extra. Of course we refused, and after waiting for about 20 minutes¢®?we were all assigned regular tents, although one couple (newlyweds) had to sleep in separate single beds. Just another awkward strange situation. Something similar again happened when we arrived at our assigned camp in Amboseli. Upon arrival, we were told that the reservation for our group had never been confirmed so that they did not really have the correct number of tents for us. So as a group, we ensured the newlyweds had the best accommodation, but that meant that the other two couples ended up with subpar, lower quality rooms (not tents) for their stay there. Don¢®?t get me wrong, the staff at this camp were outstanding and they really did everything they could to make us comfortable (thank you Henry), the problem here lies with Karibu. 

We did fully enjoy the game drives though and I must say, Castro was an excellent driver. He got us close to the animals and did everything possible to find them. That being said, he was really not a good guide. I realize this was a budget safari but basic guiding is not hard to provide (having worked in the tourism industry I feel I am well placed to say so). Simple basic information about the animals, people and places would have been appreciated. Common courtesies such as saying ¢®¡ÆGood morning, how are you?¢®?¢®? or smiling on occasion do not cost the company or the guide any more and they make a big difference in the client¢®?s experience. On some days Castro barely spoke to us and getting simple information about our day¢®?s itinerary was at times like pulling teeth. We had to ask for water on many occasions and it felt like it was an inconvenience for Castro to give it to us, when it was supposed to be provided. Some days we got a small bottle each, some days we didn¢®?t even get any. On one day, when we mentioned this, we got a snarky response  from Castro of ¢®¡Æwell¢®?did you ask for it?¢®?¢®?. Unfortunately, his attitude made us feel unwelcome and more of a burden to him than anything. We eventually all just pretty much stopped asking questions and tried to enjoy our game drives as much as possible.


There are probably another half dozen situations I could describe here that made our experience much less enjoyable than it could have been (not to mention the vehicle break-down which ended up having us wait for 5 hours for a replacement vehicle¢®?.these things happen of course, but it was the poor communication of it all and the lack of apology or any sense of compassion that made it a bad situation or the fact that there ended up being 7 of us in the van and we had to argue to ensure we remained at 6) , but I will limit myself to these.

Again, we saw some amazing animals. The game drives were excellent. But the guiding, organization and communication were very disappointing and quite below even a budget safari standards.

I would think twice before booking with Karibu.

Melinda,US,Visited: February 2020,02-May-20,35-50,first safari,Galloping Safaris Ltd,1,Broken Promises,"I booked a safari though Kenya and Tanzania with Galloping Safaris in 2019. Walter provided a nice itinerary for myself, my husband, and my two best friends. Other providers were less expensive, but Galloping Safaris had great reviews, so I went with it. Walter demanded prompt payment, that the money be wired to him immediately, which we did. The safari took place in February 2020. There were several issues throughout, including Walter and his staff not listening to requests to change small parts of our trip, lying about why we couldn't go to a place we planned to go, and skipping events we had paid for all together. We had paid for two nights at The Four Seasons Serengeti, and Walter instead had our guide take us to a less expensive hotel three hours away, one that was riddled with tsetse flies, without letting us know that we wouldn't be staying at The Four Seasons as planned/paid for. We demanded that they take us to the Four Seasons as planned the next day, but when we arrived the staff at Four Seasons let us know that Walter had not paid for our stay, and we were left sitting in the lobby. They told us that Walter often does this, and they do not extend credit to Galloping Safaris anymore, so we would have to wait until he paid to be taken to our rooms. We asked the Four Seasons staff to confirm the rest of our trip with the hotels in our packet that were booked, and not one of them had been booked or paid for. My guess is that Walter is unable to pay for the current clients' reservations until the future clients give him cash, which is why we were stuck waiting without paid reservations even though we had submitted payment in full to him many months earlier. 
When we had issues with the trip Walter ran from us, ignored our calls, had our guide disappear. We drove hours out of the way on our last day of travel to meet up with Walter and settle up our issues, and he never showed up. 
Through phone calls and emails Walter acknowledged that he was at fault and owed us a refund, which he never sent. We have contacted him multiple times and its always one excuse after the next. 
I have traveled all over the world and have never felt as scammed as I have with Galloping Safaris. I strongly recommend that you book your trip with a more reputable provider."
Melissa,DE,Visited: July 2023,03-Nov-23,20-35,first safari,Mbio Mbio Safaris,1,The name says it all: RUN RUN (Mbio Mbio),"I'm pretty sure that the good reviews here are from David himself. We had a bad experience with our safari tour. It would be too much text to list everything but now the worst: When we wanted to leave the Serengeti National Park, we waited longer than the other groups until our guide came to us and asked if we could pay the fee, because there is a system error and David's payment is therefore not registered there. We were skeptical because we had already paid everything in advance and the other groups had no problems. After asking several times, it turned out that David had kept the fee for himself and never intended to pay it. In a phone call, he simply said: ""Either you pay the fee or you're out of luck and have to spend the night there without accommodation"". After hours of waiting and many phone calls back and forth, we finally made it out. We had to drive through the park in the dark, our car broke down (we also had to pay for the repairs ourselves, otherwise we wouldn't have been able to get out of there) and so we only arrived back in Arusha late at night. During a phone call with David, we mentioned that we would give him a bad review because of all the things that had happened. He didn't wanted this under any circumstances and offered to pay for an overnight stay in the hotel. We emphasized several times that we didn't need an overnight stay because we already booked one. We also told our safari guide that we wanted to go to our hotel. When we arrived in Arusha, we were driven to a creepy backyard and it turned out that we were driven against our will to the ""hotel"" that David had booked. We were three young women and were now quite scared and had to exert real pressure to get out of there. After we asked our guide why he had taken us there against our will, he said that he had been instructed to do so by David, even if we didn't want it. After we confronted David on the phone, he offered us a refund. We will probably never see the money. I can imagine that David will try to deceive people again in the future under a different name. I can only recommend booking Safari Tours, which has been around for several years and has many reviews."
Merethe,NO,Visited: April 2018,04-Aug-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Outlook Safaris,2,Some issues during the stay - The experience got worse after contacting Outlook,"I visited Outlook in Pretoriuskop camp in April 2018, together with three other travelers. 

Although unfortunate for us, I understand unforeseen things and misunderstandings can happen. So I contacted Outlook to discuss these things, instead of going directly online to post a negative review. I also asked Outlookfor a compensation. 

I received quite an aggressive, insulting an unprofessional reply from their general manager, Steven. This leads me to give them a lot lower rating than I initially would have based on the issues during our trip only. Instead of being credited by the fact that I reached out to them, I was told that ""it is in poor taste to hold us to ransom with a threat of a review online. Please note that your decision to do so was the convincing reason in our decision as to how to conclude this matter.""!
With the conclusion being that Outlook takes no responsibility of any of our issues and that we get no apology or compensation at all.   

I would say that all in all, Outlook safari offers an ok safari packageGuides are good(we enjoyed our game drives with Jojo and especially Jeremiah). We saw quite a lot of game despite some bad weather. Tents are good, (really appreciated the night stand with power supply in each tent). Food and wine was ok to good. If you are looking for a group trip to meet new people, the setting is good for that. Beds were uncomfortable though (a standard canvas field bed would have been better than the option we got).

Our issues though:
We were not informed before arrival that we were joining a group trip(only for the very first game drive was it mentioned that we would be together with other guests from the camp). That, despite the fact that I was from the beginning requesting a camping safari in a private camp. Once I realized that a private camp is not possible in the Kruger, I booked with Outlook still, since their daily itinerary looked quite exclusive. We were therefore surprised to arrive and see that the set-up was in a group with shared meals and safari vehicles. 
The general manager addressed this issue by saying that Outlook has no control over how customers interpret the info they were given.....
...and by saying that he had looked through the information we were given, and that he could not see that it under normal circumstances could be misinterpreted by any normal people... 
....he also said that it had been clear for their booking staff, that since we were asking for a camping option, clearly we were not willing to pay the price that a private safari costs. I think that should be up to the customer itself to decide. 

Three of us got very sick during our stay. We all ate the same food, but the three that got sick all drank the dispenser water offered in the dinner-tent. And the fourth person that stayed healthy did not. After getting sick we saw the water being filled from a garden hose in the park. Outlook states the water is thoroughly filtered and therefore it is completely safe to drink. Even though water is filtered, that doesn't mean all bacteria have been removed and that everyone from around the world can safely drink it. Also, there is some question about the routine of refilling this dispenser bottle(hygiene of the bottle and the hose that they refil it from). We would have appreciated to have been informed that this was actually not prepared bottled water. Had we known, we would not have drunk it.  

Because we got sick, we missed out on meals and game drives almost equivalent to an entire 4-day safari for one of us. Reports from us that we were sick were met with comments like""That sucks!"" No one checked in with us to figure out what made us sick or if any of us needed help. According to Outlook though, this is our own fault. As we were in a setting that was different from what we expected(we weren't looking to be in a group) and as we found some behavior of the guides weird, we were being a bit reserved and tried to make the best of it and enjoy the trip together with our chosen travel mates. We didn't ask anyone to ""Leave us alone"", but we weren't being personable with the guides. By doing that, they were apparently not supposed to follow up on us when we had a problem.   

As mentioned,  we reacted to some of the behavior of a couple of the guides, resulting in us taking some distance to them for the rest of our stay:
a) If you at dinner said ""No thank you!"" to another glass of wine, the guide try to convince you to drink more. Which could be innocent enough. but it's just unnecessary. 
b) One of the guides came to our group one evening and loudly commented that we were not chatting or drinking enough. Then filled one of my travel companions glass even though she had turned it down. They could also say that this is only the guide trying to be friendly, but it's again unnecessary and unprofessional behavior. 
c) One guide got intoxicated one evening in the dinner-tent. We only heard it as we were busy being sick, but other guests had been present.   
 
Outlook stated further in their reply to me that their goal is to give customers their best holiday experience of their life. That experience we had last year while doing a private mobile safari with our own crew of three in Botswana. That experience cost us about the same as we payed for our stay with Outlook and not 10 times more as stated by Outlook that a private option would have cost us. 
We also stayed at a lodge in Sabie after our stay with Outlook. It was better and at the same price that Outlook offers(stayed in tents there as well). 

I realize and accept as stated by Outlook themselves, that most of their guests probably are happy after their stay. I guess I will also have to accept, as also stated by Outlook, that we are unfortunately part of the 1% of unhappy guests that they choose not to care about because they can ""live with it"". 

All in all I would rate their safari package(not including our issues) as an ok to good budget option. Their way of handling customers on the other hand....Unprofessional and disrespectful!"

Mette Erichsen,DK,Visited: September 2019,27-Sep-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Natural World Kenya Safaris,1,Terrible guide and vehicle!,"At first it was quit rapid, swift reply and ordering the tour was easy. 

It did a no time leave up to our expectations. 
Not because there wasn't any wildlife, but becuase our driver who was NOT near being a guid was just unprofessional, and had not knowledge 
of wildlife and the undead. His only method of finding something was to feel after all the others or via the radio to inquire about where something was. Even though we were interested in birds and told him that, he always drove past and it was more about rushing back and forth than seeing anything.

He shortened our trip in Tsavo West because he thought it was too hot. This despite the fact that at the time of day the lions can be seen.
Our trip got worse entering Tsvao in a car which should have been slanted. The dust came in all the way from and it was not possible to sit in the car and breathe.

We were actually happy when we got off at Voi train station and had to take the train to Mombasa, where we will be met by a driver from the company and driven to our next destination Chale Island.

However, it did not get any better unfortunately. We were met by an driver who was also a guide. When he found out we were going to Chale Island it was like a problem, he calles several time naming Chale Island and were upset. We would like to skip lunch and thus arrive earlier. We made this clear to him. But he thought the trip was too long train we needed lunch. Despite the fact that we insisted on skipping lunch several times, he did not. After a one hour drive we ended up at a restaurant. From the time we ordered to the food arrived, an hour and a half went by where we just waited as we arrived late for the buffet. He calls He is very rude and repeatedly scolds the staff in front of us. We feel we are at fault and are guilty of it all. He eats cake while talking while we wait for almost 2 hours for some pom fries and some chicken! 

We stopped by a supermarket to buy some water and suddenly he came in to the supermarket too. He wanted a Cola he said, and by the counter he just put it into our basket. I thought he would pick it up, when we had to pay for our stuff. But NO he did not. We ende paying for it, and that made me angry. I did not say anything, and a fex dollars are no problem for me, men it's the principles of doing it in that manner! When we finally reached to place form where we has to take the boat to Chale Island, we both agreed that he should not have any tip at all, both for delaying us for several hours and for the Cola trick. 

Then he just out of te blue says "" come on, something for the driver""? I find this manner so rood and unprofessional. 

All in all  a terrible safari with the Natural world and a terrible trip that we didn't enjoyed at any time. Miserable guide, miserable car, then it can not be good. Waste of money and precious time. 
We where on a budget safari in Uganda for 10 day before this, and has a great guid and a proper car for less amount of money pr day. 
Would never recommend it at alle. "

We gave all of our hotel pickup details in Arusha week's in advance of our safari. Nobody turned up to collect us until after 2 hours passed when we finally managed to make contact with the company and explain that we were waiting. The driver had no idea where to pick us up from. We believe if we hadn't made contact no one would have ever come to collect us. Then, on the second day of our safari the exact same thing happened, we were left stranded waiting for almost two hours and had to get our lodge staff to chase up the tour company drivers. No compensation was offered even though 4+ hours of safari time were lost/wasted by the company (this is a lot when its only a two day safari). The company was quick to take our cash at the beginning of the tour. The guides gave little or no information about the animals or parks unless we constantly asked them. They expected tips (what for!). Overall, a very poorly managed company and despite seeing lots of amazing animals (which we would have seen with any other safari company also) I would not recommend Tanzania Joy Tours to anyone! Very unprofessional and no doubt relying on outdated high review ratings!"

Michelle,SE,Visited: October 2016,03-Nov-16,20-35,first safari,Kapolondo Expeditions,1,Very Corrupt,"We were completely taken advantage of by Tony of Kapolondo Expeditions. We inquired through this website for a 5 day safari.  We were responded to promptly and given a quote for a private tour for two persons.  We paid ahead of time and thought everything was fine until Tony picked us up from where we were staying and took us to a supermarket to get in the jeep. There were 3 other people in the jeep. When I told Tony that he had booked us on a private tour, he said there must have been some confusion. I didn't have the emails printed with me then so I told him we would have to look at it and fix it. What I didn't know then either was that I was being sent with a different company 'Sandlot Tours' and we would never see Tony again. I thought we would be able to work it out with him along the way. I have all the proof that says I booked a private tour and was charged for one. I also have the proof of payment from the other people on the tour who paid half the price we did. I had our guide get a hold of Tony who said that he would sort it out when we got back.  He was supposed to transport us back to our hotel at the end as per his agreement with Sandlot Tours (which we didn't know), but he didn't show up and we were stranded in Arusha and had to find our own way back. I believe he didn't want to come meet us because I would have help him to his mistake. He will not respond to any emails I send him now even though he was very prompt before the tour. I just want the difference in money back. At first I thought he had just made an honest mistake and would fix it when he had the chance, but now I realize that he is very corrupt. I had an good time on the safari, we saw lots of wildlife, but we were definitely on the most budget tour I saw and if I paid the same as the other people I would be very happy. As it stands, I feel completely taken advantage of and I can't believe that safari bookings works with such a corrupt company!"
Michy,IL,Visited: September 2015,20-Oct-15,35-50,2-5 safaris,Africa Migration Safaris,1,Worst tour company experience I have ever had - steer clear and save yourself a headache,"So I don't even know where to begin.  Stay as far away as possible from booking with this company.  This was the most upsetting and stressful experience I have ever had traveling abroad and we travel to a different country every other year.  I am a well seasoned traveler and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had! Steer clear!

I have been long dreading writing this review but I feel that if I don't, I would be partially responsible for another traveler to have the same terrible experience that my husband and I did.  In a nutshell, we booked our tour almost one year in advance, everything we were promised/told we would get - we only got half of it, our trip was re-arranged to accommodate another couple but the problem was were staying at different locations - one was up to 52 km away, were downgraded everywhere we stayed when our ""places were booked"" (we payed for 5 star but got 2 star), in the end we were not offered any type of consolation other than endless promises during our trip and a ""I'm sorry"", and the communication with our operator was terrible since he never told us any of our places were ""overbooked"" until it happened and we had to call him... the list goes on. Our guess is that he spent our money and used it on other people.  We were also told we could pay by credit card for the remainder of our trip upon arrival but we were forced to go to a bank instead to take out money (which cost us money too), and we paid for our the remainder of our trip using our credit card as the tour progressed around Tanzania.  Very unprofessional!!!!

Let's start with our arrival day.  Flying from US to Africa was a long trek, upon arrival we were greeted at the airport by a gentleman holding up a sign with our names on it.  As everyone is loading up in their professional safari van's with logos on them, we were directed to a small toyota corolla with no room for our luggage because the driver had a large subwoofer in the trunk.  No biggie right? We just put our luggage in the car - but oh yeah, we were also waiting for two additional people who would be sharing the car with us.  Now where and how do you expect to fit four people in a toyota corolla with at least four pieces of luggage?? After about an hour at the airport trying to arrange our luggage, we ended up with some luggage on our laps, including the driver's subwoofer while my husband sat in the middle of the back seat.  Oh yeah, did I mention the trunk was broken? That was why it took us almost an hour too - we were trying to tie his trunk shut with a scarf.  So off we go to our hotels - or so we thought.  Our driver was very nice but spoke almost no English at all - and he was not the ""representative from the company"" that was supposed to meet us, he was a hired taxi driver.  So the first couple gets dropped off at their hotel but it was not the hotel they were supposed to be staying at and paid for.  It was a downgrade and they were told ""This is where I was told to drop you off.""  Next we were driven around for almost 2 hours, at 11 o'clock at night, and told that he did not know where our hotel was but we were not staying at ""Kibo palace"".   We were staying somewhere else and he had never been to that hotel and did not know where it was.  He gets on the phone with somebody by the name of Peter who tells him how to get to the new hotel we are supposed to be staying at, and the driver still couldn't find it.  Who the hell is Peter? I  tell him to get this ""Peter"" on the phone and I find out that Peter is not even a representative with our company but with a different company entirely.  Oh, but Peter is friends with our hotel owner/operator.  Peter tells us that this hotel is much nicer ( what a load of crap that was). In the end we were taken to a downgraded version of our hotel, even though we paid for something more expensive  Don't you think the owner should have contacted us prior to our arrival date and let us know that we weren't staying where we paid to stay? For someone traveling from the USA to visit Africa and then while in a taxi, be driven around and told they are not going to the hotel they were told they were is a bit nerve-wrecking and scary.  Needless to say the lack of communication is very unprofessional on the company's end. What happened to the extra money we paid for the nicer hotel? But wait! It gets better...

Day two, we meet with Julias, the owner of the company who tells us that our 5 star hotel is booked because the UN was in town and they get to bump whomever they want at the hotel regardless of whether or not the people have reservations.  (We later found out that this was a lie and our tour operator/owner never booked us there to begin with!!!!!) So we were able to get one night at the nice hotel we paid for - at this time we are told that the lodge we were supposed to stay at in the serengeti burned down and we were being upgraded to a luxury tent camp.  The problem is that the lodge burned down 8 months before we were supposed to start our vacation.  You would think the owner/company would have told us or asked us where we wanted to stay instead?? When we told him we did not want to stay in a tent camp we were told we had no other options because the other lodges were more money than what we paid for.  Don't you think at this point we deserved an upgrade, and why is this issue our problem?? We decided it was out of our control and went with the only choice we were given.  So we drive all the way from Arusha to the Serengeti (now the trip is being done in reverse too, to accommodate a couple from China who booked their trip 4 days prior).  When we get to the Serengeti we find out that the couple on the trip with us is not staying in the tent camp the second night, but rather at a nice lodge which was 52 km away on a bumpy road (1.5 hr drive each way for our driver).  So we had to end our game drive early that day so he could drop US off and have time to get the couple to their lodge.  Then he has to drive back to pick us the next morning.  During this time in the Serengeti we met another couple who were having the exact same experience we were having with the same company.

The next few days go as planned (other than our driver not being given enough money to cover our trip and we have to foot the bill by credit card and get reimbursed). Then we get to another bump in the road.  We return to Arusha to find out that we are receiving a complimentary downgrade and we will not be spending our last two nights in the 5-star hotel that we were promised we would be staying at, and that we paid to stay at.  Noooo - we are staying at a place that is a lot less nice, the food was terrible, we had no A/C and brown water coming out of the shower.  All the owner can say to us upon our arrival to this hotel is, ""I have bad news."" Surprise!!! This owner has not had ANY good news for us during our entire trip! He tells us that our hotel was booked and we will be staying at a different hotel (the downgrade).  He apologizes and offers to make it up to us by offering a free tour of a Massai Village for the next day.  At this point we are tired, sick and tired, of all the surprises and ""let-downs"" and we just want to leave.  We tell him that we do not want to go on a tour but appreciate the offer.  He asks what he can do to fix the matter and tells us he is concerned about getting a bad review. but rather we would like a partial refund.  He of course ignored that notion.  We asked him about the price difference between the two hotels and he tells us the one were staying at was $30 less per day.  We told him he owed us $60 for the two nights we were ""downgraded"".  In the end he gave us $60 back.  This would not have happened if we did not ask for it so he was going to keep the extra money we paid for a much nicer hotel.   

Stay as far away from this company as possible - it is not worth it!"

We did a safari with them and they cheated us with the contract terms. My recommendation is that if you do not pay attention to this comment CLEARLY LEAVE EVERYTHING IN WRITING WITH THESE PEOPLE, or they will deceive you as they did us.
When we decided to call her to clarify what had happened, she pestered us all the time saying that she was very busy and couldn't. She only called us back when we said we would speak to the police, and it was to yell at us and speak to us in a very rude and obscene tone.
In addition, our driver throughout the SAFARI, did not stop doing a reckless driving with the phone in his hand all the time and in the other driving talking on whatsapp, calling on the phone and playing mobile apps or games while he had to drive and be attentive To the road.

Miguel Medialdea,ES,Visited: February 2019,18-Mar-19,50-65,over 5 safaris,Orongai Africa Safari,1,A disappointing experience,"This is in response to the reply from Orongai to a review made by Jose Luis Garcia, in relation to our recent (and disappointing) safari to northern Tanzania under this company.

To accuse unsatisfied clients (who, even dissatisfied, paid for the service and left a substantial tip) of being racist is a vile deed and shows a surprising awkwardness. Orongai does not seem to have heard about Quality Management procedures, a set of work guidelines that are mandatory in the operation of any company providing services or selling products (in Africa, Europe or wherever...), and whose ultimate goal is the achievement of customer satisfaction. I would appreciate to know what is the quality policy of this company, in case it has something slightly similar...

When in a respectable business a complaint is received from a client, the first thing that has to be done is an investigation of the claim??s cause. Then, an internal process is initiated in which corrective and preventive measures are implemented, and finally a convincing explanation (together with a compensation if necessary) is offered to the customer. What is never done is to accuse the client of falsehood or discrimination in his dealings with the company. And this is exactly what Orongai has done with us. Orongai must be able to recognize that, at least, in the agreement he signed with us there was a lack of transparency and an extremely poor information management.

It is not worth commenting on the words that Orongai claims to have heard from some members of our group. They are as false as saying that the ITAKA SAFARIS manager proclaimed himself Ambassador of Spain (amazing observation !!)... It is convenient that the members of Orongai dedicate some time to improve their Spanish skills (and maybe also their English ones...).

Orongai demonstrates an immense arrogance in his dealings with clients, and this is something that can easily be deduced from previous claims to this company which still circulate on internet. The difference is that, while other customers ended up accepting Orongai's last-minute impositions (however unjustified they may be), we demanded an explanation and requested the mediation of an external agent (ITAKA??s manager), simply with the legitimate goal of clarifying the situation. And this point, which is an inalienable right of anyone who pays for a product or service, seemed to infinitely offend Orongai. If I am white and you are black, and I intend to exercise my legitimate rights, does it follows that I am a racist? Orongai should seriously think about it...

Finally, Orongai??s proposal of offering a 15% discount to new clients as a sign of generosity and professionalism,  it is nothing more than an outdated and clumsy way of terminating a dispute, and it presupposes the tacit acknowledgment that a customer who placed his trust in Orongai has been unfairly treated.

Other Tanzanian safari operators, as well as national organizations of tour operators and agencies dedicated to tourism and the dissemination of the extraordinary natural values ??of Tanzania, should take good note of the behavior of Orongai.

Mihaela B.,CA,Visited: July 2018,05-Sep-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Bush Baby Calls,1,Joke of a tour operator - Avoid at all cost!!! Complete lack of safety,"Horrible experience - MG met us at the border between Zimbabwe and Botswana - took our money and luggage and then was supposed to pick us up at a certain time after we visited Victoria Falls. They were late in picking us up. Then we had a lovely time in Chobe National Park, which was the only positive experience with them. As soon as we started our camping safaris - one disaster after another.  We rode in an open safari vehicle at high speed for 3-4h to get to the dirt road leading to Savuti. We then got to the game reserve gate 90 minutes after its closing time and then drove at night! (strictly forbidden) for another 5h to find our campsite - the guide could not find the camp - we were scared, tired, frustrated, cold and hungry. Second day, we were on a game drive and our driver went offroad and took us within 15m of a pride of lions. He stopped the engine and then the car would not start again. We were completely exposed and luckily another safari vehicle came and pulled our car out. The driver would never fill up the car¢®?s gas tank so we were left without gas at one point in Kalahari, without water. Driver had to abandon the car and us to go in search of help - no cell phone signal. At no time we were told how long the drives would take to get from one place to the next and they notoriously underestimated the durations. We never made it in time to any of the game reserve gates. We were exposed to unsafe trip conditions on more than one occasion. Driver and his safari vehicle were subcontracted by MG and each one blamed the other for all the mishaps. Absolutely horrific."
Milo,UK,Visited: August 2023,28-Sep-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Walking Stick Travel & Tours,2,A once in a lifetime trip with a few issues...,"We had a 13 day tour with walking stick tours in August of 2023. Botswana itself is an incredible country with some of the friendliest people, and some of the most incredible wildlife we¢®?d encountered anywhere. All 5 of us highly recommend a trip to the country for safari. Unfortunately our experience of walking stick tours was less stellar. 

I¢®?ll start with the good (of which there is plenty) :
- The food that Jo & team prepared for us was absolutely incredible, better than we had In restaurants elsewhere, and all cooked over an open fire! The team were always friendly and happy to help with any requests, we had beer and wine at dinner and no shortage of clean bottled water. We were really well taken care of at camp the entire 2 week trip. 
- Prior to the trip communication was good and we were picked up at the airport.
- We had a great guide, Wago. He spoke very good English and had excellent knowledge of the flora & fauna of Botswana. We had a lovely time getting to know him and he got us some truly amazing wildlife sightings. 
- Onto the sightings generally, we had great views of lion, leopard, cheetah, even an early morning wild dog sighting - really special. 

The negatives: 
- Our vehicle (named desert honey badger) was in a constant state of disrepair. We broke down several times every single day, the brakes on the car weren¢®?t functional, and we had to veer off road at points when vehicles approached along the same stretch of road. We were repeatedly told that the car was being replaced or fixed but the issues persisted for the entire trip. This impacted our game viewing and massively impacted our travel time, by the end of the trip we were taken in an alternate vehicle, but this was far too little and much too late. 
- Communication on the trip itself was poor, the issues with the vehicle and what was (or in fact wasn¢®?t) being done was never properly communicated to us. We were misled daily about getting the vehicle repaired or replaced, but this never happened. We¢®?ve been on safari before and know how ad-hoc things are sometimes, but this was a step beyond. 
- In an attempt to make up for the constant issues with the vehicle we were offered a ¢®¡Æcomplimentary¢®¡¾ trip to Victoria falls in place of a game drive as our vehicle wasn¢®?t functional. This was in fact not complimentary, and we paid $500+ for the day ourselves. 

Since our trip we have reached out to Phillimon to open a dialogue with no intent for compensation, but we have been ignored. We absolutely loved Botswana and can¢®?t recommend it enough as a safari destination, but we¢®?d recommend you go with another operator instead of walking stick.

Miriam Little,UK,Visited: March 2015,31-Mar-15,20-35,2-5 safaris,Meru Mountain Treks & Safaris,1,Not recommenable at all,"I booked a 4-days-Safari to Lake Manyara National Park, Ngorongoro Crater and Serengeti National Park and ended up doing the tour with a very friendly french family. At first, also the owner of the company seemed to be a nice guy. Later that turned out to be a false first impression. 

The first day we stayed in small bomas, the dinner was reasonable and their was enough food.
We found out the next morning that a another guy would join us for the next three days. Unfortunatly, we had to wait for him, which delayed our drive to the next park, but was of course not the fault of the very friendly south korean guy, who told us that he actually didn't book his safari with the same company we did. Before he joined us, we also spend about an hour at a garage to get the shocker of the jeep repeared.

The time we spend in the parks was great, we saw many animals and really enjoyed it. The smallest problem we had, was that the zippers of the tents that the safari company provided couldn't be closed. One of the things we really got annoyed about was that the driver and the cook didn't stick to the programm which was given to us when me made the booking. One morning, we should have left at six, but they said seven would be early enough because we would have been at another park to early. This would have ment an extra payment, as it was planned for us to stay until afternoon the next day (as you might know the entrance fee is only valid for 24 hours) and only goes to show that the programm was actually full of promises that weren't kept. 

Another problem was the fact that there was not enough food for 5 people. When we came to the campsites after a long day, we had to wait for our food for more than an hour twice, while all the other travellers from other companies were already served. It made me upset, when the cook even delayed our moring game drive because he obivously didn't get up early enough to prepare breakfast. The portions were small and compared to what we were served the first evening and what people from other budget safari tours were having, the choice was too.

Also, I had the impression that our driver had no idea where he was going and didn't seem to have control over the car at all. On the way out of the Serengeti we almost overturned after a speed bump and drove into the bushes. How could the driver or the cook even dare to ask for a tip after their services had been so horrible?

When we came back to Arsuha and spoke to Ibrahim, the owner of the company, he wouldn't even listen to us. I was in his office with the french lady and her son. The cook had been taking pictures of some rice and a tiny bit of sauce we left over, so Ibrahim shouted at us and said we were lying when saying there was not enough food. He wouldn't even listen when we told him that we didn't finsh the food because their was no meat, no vegetables, barely some sauce and only this pile of rice left over. It was not possible to have a proper conversion with him and after he had called me a ""bitch""and said ""fuck you"" to me, I decided to leave the office, because this was just getting ridiculous. The french lady asked me to stay which was not a good idea at all, because Ibrahim got very aggressive. We asked him again to stop shouting at us and really felt like I was in kindergarten. When I told him he was behaving like a child, he got up, took my glasses, cracked them into pieces and threw them on the floor. He even shouted silly things about us being christans, complained about us using up to much of the milk powder, claimed he had never had any complaints like this and reproached us for having too high expectations concerning the food.  I really could't believe it! Just because he didn't want to take the critism of his clients serious, especially not from a white yound lady, he got violent. Moreover, he pushed the french lady out his office and might have broke her arm. I didn't find out, because they left the next morning.

I haven't experienced anything like that in the last 7 months in Tansania and Uganda. Next time I would definetly spend a hundred dollars more to avoid this kind of hassle. There is still no guarantee that everything will work out fine then, but I think in this case it's worth spending a little bit more money!"

They did not return any money, they only paid us a bus for 10 euros, instead of a minimum 150e. The guide driver did not explain anything to us. It was very monotonous and boring. Neither warned us where there was wifi or not. Excellent Masai Mara, of course, regardless of the safari company. I would not repeat."
Mohammad,PT,Visited: August 2016,31-Aug-16,20-35,first safari,Kapolondo Expeditions,1,Tony Kapolondo is a fraud,"We had a horrible time with this tour operator. A friend and I booked with him for our first safari, planning to see Tanzania¢®?s wildlife in mid-luxury lodges. We also paid him upfront for a hot air balloon tour over the Serengeti. 

When we arrived, we were a bit surprised at the status of the car, as we expected a more modern vehicle. The next morning, we were told that we will not be staying in the lodges we planned to stay in according to our itinerary; instead he booked us sub-par lodges for less money, including a two night stay in a tented camp outside Serengeti instead of Serena and Lobo as we originally paid him. He also informed us that the hot air balloon, which we paid USD 550 each for, is not likely to happen. His excuse was that since we changed flights by arriving a day earlier (we informed him of the change 2.5 weeks before our departure, and paid him in full a week prior to that) then it made the accommodations and balloon tour very difficult. Prior to our departure, however, he told me that all the bookings for hotels are done, implying it was based on the original itinerary. 

We later discovered that there were no bookings. The first place we were to stay in instead of Flamingo Lodge was not paid for and so we ended up staying in a tiny room with problems with hot water and wifi. Tony did not answer me when I asked him that night on the reason why our ¢®?big room¢®? was booked already, even though he supposedly confirmed the bookings beforehand. After that, we moved to Serengeti where Tony told us the tented camp we¢®?d be staying in would be ¢®¡Æluxury¢®¡¾. We ended up staying in a tent with no hot water, and no wifi, either. We had serious issues that day, as he told us one thing and gave us something completely opposite. We paid Tony good money expecting a service and accommodation based on what we agreed, but that has not been provided. 

All his excuses turned out to be false. On the night before we were supposed to go to Rhino Lodge for Ngorongoro, the driver informed us that Tony told him we¢®?re staying in Karatu, instead. He also told him that we¢®?ll do a short drive in Ngorongoro on our way out of Serengeti stating that there is no availability in Rhino Lodge. At this point we were sick of his lies, so we contacted Rhino Lodge ourselves and found there¢®?s a room available. We informed him of this, and lo and behold, Kapolondo miraculously ¢®?found¢®? availability and booked a room for us. 

Before we move on to the rest of the tale, before our departure, my friend found a balloon company in Serengeti and contacted them regarding Kapolondo booking. We were informed that there¢®?s no booking in that name. Tony told us he booked with a different company. At the time, we trusted him, unfortunately. When we arrived in Serengeti, we contacted the other balloon operator (there are only two), and they informed by phone and email that there are no booking under Kapolondo name. Tony told us, bizarrely, that he booked under a different name.

His lies continued and he wanted to charge us for the last night in Mvuli lodge, even though it was already included in the itinerary, and he tried to get out of arranging us transfers to the airport. After talking to him, he finally relented and agreed to give us what we already paid him to do. There was no booking, and he had to transfer money after we talked to him. 

Tony decided not to hold himself to any of the agreed upon itinerary we paid him to do, and instead he wanted to keep our money to himself without regards to our agreement or the fact that we honored our part and paid him in full well in advance. He claimed he will provide copies of vouchers on the original itinerary, including the supposed balloon tour when we arrived in Arusha, but that turned out to be another lie as we didn¢®?t even see him on our last day. He is a fraud and you should avoid him at all costs."

Mohan,US,Visited: February 2019,01-Mar-19,65+,2-5 safaris,All Seasons Safaris and Tours,1,A few words of caution,"I am reproducing below my note to the Kenya Association of Tour Operators. Please review it before making a decision as to whether you should use All Seasons for your travel planning.

Dear Sir/Madam,

I write to you regarding my recent experience with All Seasons Safaris & Tours, and it¢®?s owner Alex Thuku. I am not sure if I am reaching the correct office to report what I think of as patently unethical behavior. If I should be contacting an entirely different office kindly direct me to the correct one.

In the interest of brevity I will summarize the charge. I contacted All Seasons for travel arrangements to Uganda,  and Tanzania back in June of 2018. Of the total estimate of $ 23,940 I made a deposit of $8,692 soon after. The trip was to commence in February 2019. The quote included all lodges, air travel in east Africa, park fees and guide services. In September I was informed that all bookings had been made and were confirmed. The balance of payments were made by late November 2018. 

We arrived in Entebbe on February 5, 2019 and realized immediately that very few of the arrangements that had been promised and confirmed had been made. It set the local agent in Uganda (James Kateeba of Travellust) scrambling to just get us to our first destination. For the next twelve days we had to pursue Mr. Thuku on a daily basis. I have copied below my note to him on February 13th to give you a flavor of the dilemma we faced almost every day during our journey.

¢®¡ÆAlex, though all of this messaging  back and forth, you seem to miss an essential fact. You betrayed a customer trust by misappropriating his funds, and using them for personal needs. The funds were to be used to confirm,  and pay all of our travel and stay in Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya. Instead, you used the funds elsewhere,  scrambling to make our arrangements day by day, after we landed. We in turn have had ten days of constant anxiety as you were trying to stay just one day ahead of us, and finally could not even do that. To sum it up, you have ruined a long anticipated, and carefully planned vacation which cost us a significant amount of money. Your partners in Uganda and Tanzania, and I dealt with you as a man of integrity. You have proven to be anything but.¢®¡¾


In addition to Mr. Kateeba in Uganda, Mr. Omar Mshana of Tanzania Insideout Discovery, Patricia of Kibo Palace Hotel and Junia O¢®?kubasu of Serena Nairobi were all similarly inconvenienced by Mr. Thuku¢®?s almost cavalier approach to his obligation. Our trip finally reached a point where he no longer could pay for the services for which he had already received payment, months ahead of time. I ended up making duplicate payments for a number of hotels and airlines so that we could conclude the trip. I have a complete list of emails with Mr. Thuku, What¢®?s App messages and bank transfer documents for every aspect of the charge I level here. Please advise me if I should forward them to your attention.

I am deeply disappointed in my experience with All Seasons. In addition to the substantial additional cost I incurred, and the trying days just to gain clarity on what exactly was happening around us, I was left with a sour taste in my use of a local tour operator. About three years ago (when I was conducting a workshop for senior executives for government and industry leaders in Nairobi), a senior executive strongly urged me to support and use local operators for my travel plans in east Africa. This experience certainly gives me pause. I would be much more cautious, in using or recommending that any of my family or friends do so.

I am displeased enough with the entire affair that I mean to do all I can to ensure that Mr. Thuku and All Seasons are held accountable for their inappropriate conduct. I would hate to see someone to have to go through the same experience. An equally disturbing aspect of our experience is that it casts a long shadow on local operators in Kenya, in general. I am not aware of which the correct regulatory (or self regulatory) agency is within which to formally lodge a complaint, and to look to recover the additional money I had to spend to duplicate what was already sent to Mr. Thuku. I would be grateful for any direction you can provide me.

Please also advise me if I should also drop a note to the Ministry of Travel and Wildlife. I am happy to do so.

Thank you for your attention to my complaint.

Please do never use¢®¡¾ jjtoursandsafaris¢®¡¾, JJ Tours¢®¡¾, ¢®¡Ænzuri sana safaris, Nzurisana Safari¢®¡¾ while you are travelling to Africa, Tanzania or any tours they are taking part at. 

My husband and I visited Tanzania for a week in October for our honeymoon. We have booked Hilton Nungwi by ourselves, and asked Hilton to refer us an agency who would drive us to safari for two days. All our payments made by cash the day they have picked us from the airport. Our 4 days at Nungwi was perfect. Two days of our so called ¢®¡Æsafari¢®¡¾- there are no words to describe the awfulness and how we agitated our life safety.

1.    JJ Tours and Safaris did not make the 4 night¢®?s payment on behalf of us to the Hilton Nungwi even though we have paid all tour payment the first day we have arrived to Tanzania. Our agreement and booking was for 4 nights, but they only paid 3 nights to the hotel. Thus Hilton had charged extra 210 Dollars for us, and we needed to pay that money to check out from the hotel. 

2.    JJ Tours and Safari drove us to Mikumi National Park by the oldest car, which had no seat belt at the back seat, and which had stopped during our travel. Driver (Francisco Swebe- nzurisanasafaris) had bribed the police two times for breaking the speed limit, and once for not having the seat belt. 

3.

There was nothing left for him to do- so he drove us to TanSwiss. I swear to God, the hotel had maximum 15 guests, and it was like empty. 

4.    Second LieWhen we arrived the hotel- TanSwiss- we learned that this hotel is ¢®¡Æbed and breakfast¢®¡¾, and although we have paid for full package for two days; our guide (Francisco Swebe ) tried to make us pay our dinner and lunch. 

5.    Third LieIf I get the chance to upload pictures, I will upload the car that they have taken us to Safari. (We could not bear and asked driver to bring us back at the end of 2 hours). The car did not have a key and any protection. It was working hotwire(Putting cables together etc.¢®?). 

6.    From October to December- we have been in touch with Kuya Mbogoma, to make him pay our 210 dollars back. Like a joke, he has sent us only 65 dollars! 

7.    Tours Company is ¢®¡ÆJJ Tours¢®¡¾, ¢®¡ÆJJTours and Safaris¢®¡¾. We have been defrauded by Kuya Mbogoma and his partner company ¢®¡Ænzurisanasafaris¢®¡¾ Francisco Swebe. The cars you see at their web pages are not the ones that they used while driving us. Do not believe in these two companies offerings. If this happened to us, it may happen to you too.

She was not reachable two days before the safari. Driver and vehicle details were not shared until i made 20 calls to various numbers. finally number was shared on saturday 19.00 hrs for sunday morning safari and to my surprise, the mentioned driver never came instead send some other driver.
this is pathetic and frustrating for the monies paid. i will recommend not to choose bonfire because of very poor customer service.

Nader,SA,Visited: August 2019,26-Aug-19,20-35,first safari,Rhino Explorer Tours & Safaris,2,Not recommended Safari organizer,"I booked with this company based on the many positive reviews I read on this website. I arrived on the first day, the pick up was OK, I spent the whole day in Arusha as per the trip schedule. The second (trip first day) was generally OK. By end of day, however, our guide Malaki dropped me off at Kilimamoja lodge and immediately left, I went to the reception to check in, but the responsible person there advised there is no reservation in my name, I tried to contract Malaki but he did not answer, and it almost took 1 hour to check in, while all other guests of other companies checked in smoothly without any issues. Rhino response on WhatsApp is too slow.

The pick up time on the second day was set by Malaki at 7:00-7:30 AM. I waked up at 5:30 to be ready on time, he texted me at 7:17 AM saying that a couple from the same group who were on camping accommodation asked to buy some camping stuff, they also requested not to wake up early since they were on honeymoon. The driver eventually arrived for pick up on 10:40 AM although we had a long way driving to Serengeti.

At this point, I preferred not to continue the trip with this company, and I arranged for private Safari with Savannah Explorer & I was lucky to do so.

I met with other couple of the same group by coincidence at a lodge in Northern Serengeti, they advised that Rhino were just cheating, the couple who were on honeymoon never asked for buying stuff or waking up late & this was Malaki's arrangement. Similarly, Malaki informed this couple that the pick delay came at my request. 

On other side, I contacted Malaki after withdrawal from the group trip to contact Danial to confirm the balance due to Rhino since I did not pay any of the due amount from the very beginning, Malaki told the group that I am in contact with him asking to re-join the group since no other company accepted to arrange a trip for me. In addition, he sent me a video on WhatsApp of 2 lions hunting a Wildebeest as if he took this video during the trip to show me that I missed a lot due to my leave, Malaki did not notice that the car hood that appeared in the video had a logo other than Rhino's logo, which is indicating that the video was not taken by him at all.

Finally, Daniel contacted me during my stay in Tanzania threatening me that he will refer to the governmental authorities in order not to let me go out of Tanzania until I pay his money although he asked to pay through the website & the website delayed in sending the payment link. I left Tanzania on 21.08.2019 and remained in contact with him to pay his money. I paid him on 26.08.2019 and had the option not to pay him at all, but I finally paid him $861 as per his request from a moral perspective only.

Nadine,DE,Visited: July 2022,29-Aug-22,20-35,first safari,Kenamoti Tours,1,Unprofessional tour operator,"I would not recommend booking a safari through Kenamoti Tours.
We booked a 3-day Masai Mara safari through safaribooking.com (3-Day Masai Mara 4x4 Land Cruiser Safari). An important criterion for us was to have a real 4x4 safari vehicle (as opposed to minibuses). Therefore, we booked a safari that included the 4x4 vehicle. 
Communication with the tour organization was mainly through a man named Amos. He was flexible with the tour dates, which was nice since our itinerary changed slightly. 
However, when we got to his office to discuss final details and make payment, he wanted the money in cash, which we were not prepared for. During our trip we learned that it is common in Kenya to pay even larger amounts in cash. We were able to arrange with Amos to pay only a deposit in cash and pay the rest when we were picked up, which seemed more convenient. 
On the day of the pickup, we were picked up around 9am by two people (the booked tour originally stated 7am) who drove us to the bus. It turned out that our safari vehicle was one of the minibuses and not the promised 4x4 vehicle. After some discussion with the staff, our only options were to cancel the tour (and probably not get our deposit back) or settle for what we got and pay the full amount. We decided to go ahead with the tour since we didn't have time to find another tour. When we arrived at the camp, it turned out to be a different camp than the tour description stated. Also, the tour description said that there was a maximum of 6 people per vehicle (we were 8), which was quite uncomfortable at times. According to the tour description, there was supposed to be another morning game drive on the third day. The driver informed us that the plans had been changed and instead of the game drive we would only have the option of visiting the Masai village (for $10). We were able to negotiate with the driver and he organized an alternative ""plant medicine walk"" with one of the Masai for free. In the end, it was a nice tour with good game drives, but the fact that we were tricked into a tour that was significantly cheaper than what we paid was very disappointing. Therefore, we give this tour provider a poor rating and would not recommend anyone to book with this provider. Amos is not able to properly plan the bookings he receives, which ends in chaos and disappointment. "
Naheed,IN,Visited: September 2017,02-Nov-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,Safari Line Defender,1,Disappointing....waste of money... major let down!!!,"Having come close to the end of my tour in East africa, and having had an amazing time, i couldn't leave without visiting the masai mara. So I enquired about the 1 night 2 day tour with safari line defenders, Rose was helpful at that time and gave me lots of details about the tour regarding timings and what I should expect. Pleased with the information I had received I booked the tour...only to find out everything she had told me was a lie. She had basically falsified the details just to make a sale. She claimed the game drive would be 12hours over the 2 days, which I thought was a bit of a stretch for 2 days but it's her job she knows best, right?. No,? We drove for a maximum of 3 over the 2 days, so much time was wasted waiting around. We arrived at the campsite on the 1st day at 3pm ( although Rose said we'd be there for 1pm) and we waited around wasting time for the driver to take us on the drive at 4.30pm. Inside the masai mara,? the driver didn't make an effort to point out any animals or provide information about any of them. After 2hours of driving we returned to the camp...disappointed is an understatement of what I was feeling at this point, but I had the following day to look forward to. Come the second day we were ready to leave as requested at 6.30am. We made our way to the mara, drove around the same area again with not much of interest. The driver had told me the night before I would have to change groups, as the group I was with was not return today so I had to join a different group to return back. So he rang another driver to find out if I could get into their vehicle... in the middle of the masai mara I had to get out of my vehicle an into another. So the tour/ nightmare? continued so we drove around spotting some lions n cheeters on the way. At 8am the driver said we will now drive back. I was shocked I had paid a grate deal of money for this?? So we returned. The driver was to drop each of the group members back to our hotels, I said I wanted to go to the office as I wasn't happy with the tour. He decided to make a phone call to let the office know. Personally I think it was to forewarn Rose about how i felt. On arrival at the office, surprise surprise Rose was nowhere to been seen. The guy at the office said it was Rose's sale so he couldn't do anything and said Rose would call me that evening ( I was flying out of Kenya 5am the following morning). The evening came and went and I received no form of communication from Rose. I wasn't going to miss my flight so I packed my bags and returned to the UK. Rose did message and her resolution was to offer me a free tour the next time I came, I wouldn't be returning to Kenya any time soon to a couldn't take the offer, I told her. I requested a refund, but she refused and said I had to email the director of the company about my complaint, which I did. Did I get a response? No, no surprise there. 
All in all a very disappointing experience and waste of money. I wouldn't recommend this tour company to anyone. If you want to experience a real game drive don't use this company."
Nanci & Stephen,US,Visited: July 2023,22-Aug-23,65+,first safari,African Sunsets Travel,1,Subcontracted our Private tour to the Lowest Bidder,"In January ¢®?22 (6 months before our departure date) we booked The Great Kenya & Tanzania PRIVATE Circuit - 13 Days Safari and Cultural Experience offered by Sunsets in Africa.

FIRSTLY, before our complaints are listed, We want to make it clear that WE HAVE NO COMPLAINT with our KENYAN DRIVER/ GUIDE. (His real name is Safari) Safari was informative, polite, and quite a good driver ? he made sure we had a great vantage point to view the animals. All the other Kenyan drivers seemed to know and like him.  We missed him once we arrived in Tanzania.

The majority of our complaints are a result of Sunsets in Africa's subcontracting our PRIVATE tour to the lowest bidder: TOPHANSTANZANIAADVENTURE.COM  

The owner of TOPHANSTANZANIAADVENTURE.COM who also became our ¢®¡Æguide¢®¡¾ in Tanzania was named Hans. After returning home, we researched his company and found that Hans¢®? offers a 12 day tour of Kenya & Tanzania(not 13)  with a minimum of 5-6 people (NOT PRIVATE) for 1/3 $ of what we had paid to Sunsets in Africa. This explains A LOT! 

We blame both SUNSETS IN AFRICA AND TOPHANSTANZANIAADVENTURE.COM for this following, (condensed) negative review: 
>>>>
Our tour was booked and paid for as a PRIVATE party of two, but upon meeting Hans he informed us that we would be traveling with another private party of 2!  (Neither party agreed with that arrangement but we were stuck!) 
>>>>
Our PRIVATE tour was also supposed to included nice 4* lodges (Yes, they were nice in Kenya) but when Hans himself took over in Tanzania he took us to a Tent cabin on the outskirts of Serengeti which had a picnic table for a restaurant/bar!!  This was Not at all Similar to the Serengeti Serena Lodge on our itinerary!
>>>>
Hans was NOT a professional guide (he almost never had his radio on in the parks to communicate with the other guides and was always talking or texting on his phone instead of talking to/informing us)
 >>>>
I inquired about the cost of a Night Game Drive and Hans told me that would cost $950.00 USD for 4 people. I declined saying it was out of my budget¢®? Hans replied by asking ¢®¡Æwhat is your budget?¢®¡¾  At that point I had a feeling there was a possibility of a scam so I ended the conversation.  A few days later on day 7 of out tour, at Lake Manyara Lodge they offered a night drive for $55.00 USD per person!!! 
>>>>
On day 11, Hans LEFT US STRANDED at our Lake Manyara Lodge until 4pm (1600 hrs.)!  He wasted an entire day!   
>>>>>
Instead of transporting us from Arusha to the Nairobi airport himself, he hired a man w a VERY SMALL car to take the 4 of us and our luggage from the border to the Nairobi airport.  (We had luggage on our laps! for several hours)
>>>>
We have gone on many private tours around the world, but never had a ""guide"" as rude, devious, and unprofessional as Hans of TOPHANSTANZANIAADVENTURE.COM .
>>>>
THE BEST TIP I WOULD GIVE THIS ¢®¡ÆGUIDE¢®¡¾ WOULD BE ¢®¡ÆHANS GET OUT OF THE TOUR INDUSTRY!¢®¡¾

Natalie,AE,Visited: December 2016,03-Jan-17,20-35,first safari,Mercury Tours,1,A whole disaster and very terrible experience - watch out with this agency! Not trustful at all,"We found Mercury Tours on Safari-Bookings and Ndamungu (tour operator) seemed to be nice and helpful. We were having email contact for about two weeks in which Mercury Tours explained the Program in detail and gave us all information etc. In November 2016 we booked the 7 day safari with him (Selous-Mikumi-Ruahu Safari) to start on January, 1st 2017. We transferred half of the money to Ndamungu in November (1330 Dollar) and agreed to pay the other half directly to the tourguide when the safari would start. Ndamungu confirmed that the tourguide would pick us up at 8.40AM in our Hotel. Well, we were all excited to start the Safari and on January, 1st we waited to be picked up in our hotel reception. Unfortunately, no one from Mercury Tours appeared, so after 30 minutes waiting, we called Ndamungu. He said, that the driver had an ""accident"" and would come within 20 minutes. Unfortunately, this was not true. We waited for hours, calling Mercury Tours several times and Ndamungu said the guide could come very soon and hung up on us with no more information. So, we ended up waiting for about 4,5 (!) with another disappointment. Ndamungu confirmed in November that our driver would be our guide at the same time and would speak English. The person who picked us up just spoke barely English and had no idea of our program and where to go, so he had to explain him everything. Above all, he forced us to pay him 200 dollar otherwise he wouldn't drive us and explained us the actual guide was waiting for us at the camp. Well, we were very angry at the time, but paid him and hoping that the real guide would actually speak English and we could finally start our safari without more stress and headache. When we arrived at the camp, unfortunately no guide was waiting for us. The driver and Ndamungu explained, the guide would come the next day but this was another lie. The next day, the driver was gone without saying a word, no guide appeared and we were left alone literally in the bush. The people at the camp were really helpful and called Ndamungu serval time, but he just switched off his phone. Nothing was organised, nothing was paid for us. So, we lost 1530 Dollar and didn't receive anything for it. We went for a game drive with another guide but had to pay all by ourselves. Our safari was a whole disaster and tomorrow we are heading to the police and embassy here in Tanzania to report on this. Luckily we have all confirmations made by Ndamungu. So be very careful with Mercury Tours and Ndamungu - they are criminals. "
Nathalie,UK,Visited: April 2022,01-May-22,50-65,first safari,Swahili Paradise Tours & Safaris,2,untrustworthy,"I booked this 3 day tour, clearly stating that because I was alone I wanted to join a group. I received my itinerary in advance, 1 daydrive to the National park followed by a driving safari from afternoon to the evening. Day 2 driving all day, day 3 return. 
2 days before the start of the safari, I got a message saying that the plan had changed, the people I was supposed to be with had changed their mind, and therefore I would go on a walking safari on the first day as ""it would be great and I would be closer to the animals"". 
On arrival, the ranger laughed at me as I was in trainers. What I  did not know was that due to the rain season the terrain was muddy and I would need boots, which I did not have. I managed to borrow a pair that were 2 sizes too small and we went off anyway. Again due to the rain season the grass was very high and almost impossible to walk, suffice to say I saw absolutely nothing. 
Jimmy the organiser knew this and when I told him this was not ok, the reaction was that as I was alone I was costing him too much and what I had paid for did not cover his expenses. This should not have been my concern. Thankfully day 2 was very good but only due to a great guide Amir.  Also any local will tell you that safari is either early morning or evening, not all day. Jimmy is not honest and you should chose another tour."
Naz,ZA,Visited: August 2021,11-Feb-22,35-50,over 5 safaris,Baboon Budget Safaris,2,Give them a miss,"I booked a 12 day tour through Kenya and Tanzania. Seven wonders managed the Tanzanian side and I couldn't have been happier with them. The Kenyan side( Nakuru, Masai, Amboeseli) was managed by Baboon budget who the booking was made through. It started of badly with being collected late at the airport and having to run around in  trying to find a person, who wasn't there. The accommodations throughout were poor esp the Eco camp in Masai with very poor quality food. The worst was the lack of personal attention, we were passed like luggage from one driver and group to another depending on their schedules, groups, etc. one traveler had been with 5 different drivers/guides in 5 days! The quality of drivers was potluck. Michael our initial guide tried really hard, but was with us for only one day.  Another driver/guide, Jackson, (apparently quite senior )who had previously been haring around at ridiculous speeds , all of a sudden started going at a crawl in circles for more than an hour and included a pitstop an hour into the trip ""to stretch our legs"". We later determined that a vehicle transporting a traveler who was due to join our group after a balloon ride got stuck in some mud and teh driver was unable to provide co ordinates so we drove in circles trying to connect with them. Jackson initially tried to deny this but i had my GPS on so showed it to him. His response was that the tour hadn't stopped as we were ""moving"". The point of this trip was to observe a river crossing. It was clear to all that the second day this may happen. Approximately 20 othre vehicles waited patiently along the Mara for this to start. Jackson in his wisdom decided it wouldn't happen and drove off. Needless to say he was connected on radio to say it had started and we raced back  . already an eighth of the herd of thousands of wildebeest had crossed. WE all thought we wre in for a treat as so many more had to make their way across. Again Jackson surprised us, we observed for about 5mins( I filmed it, so it was actually less) and he started driving off. We though this was to secure a better vantage point. But no, he drove out the park! Then proceeded to dump us outside the accommodation to await another person to conduct the tour to the Masai village. Clearly he had another pressing appointment!

Things just went downhill...

There's many other companies available , however it seems that they operate differently from other countries group tours. Schedules and people interconnect throughout, with no personalised service or accountability.

They should take some tips from Seven Wonders on how to operate..."
nazeema101,ZA,Visited: December 2019,03-Jan-20,35-50,over 5 safaris,Hail Tours Uganda,2,Great nature experience marred by unprofessional company,"An amazing trip that was soured by, Doreen Kesiime, the owner. I was willing to overlook some of the more annoying/disappointing things.Like being harassed on a daily basis for proof of payment. I made a late booking-10 days b4 travel- on a Friday evening before a long weekend and informed Doreen the bank would therefore authorise the transaction on Tuesday. Despite this I received multiple messages on a daily basis during the weekend requesting proof of payment, repeatedly informing me about difficulties obtaining permits last minute, etc, all of which we were both aware of! 

On arrival in Entebbe, Doreen was picked up joined the tour for the full duration. I was therefore expecting everything to go according to plan.Between her fielding numerous personal and work calls during game drives and walks in conservation areas, littering in conservation areas, making several  inappropriate remarks( eg how she would report homosexuals to the police and going into graphic detail why she found anal sex disgusting, commenting that my preference for coffee made "" a woman dry down there""), I decided her presence did not add value to the experience. Changes were made to the itinerary without discussing it or informing me- I did the Gorilla trek form a different location( only informed on arrival to Bwindi), only 2 of the 5 accommodations on my itinerary were booked( one was changed due to tracking from a different location).

Again,because I truly enjoyed the activities thus far on the tour( Chimpanzee tracking in Kibale, Queen Elizabeth National park, Batwa People community walk, Gorilla Tracking) I didn't make too much of a fuss. 

The last straw however was being taken to an inferior accommodation then the one in the itinerary at Lake Bunyoni. This was the afternoon following the gorilla tracking when I was looking forward to a decent shower and bed to sleep in( not always possible at the other accommodations booked- at one lodge the drain was blocked and flooded the entire room)) What was infuriating was that this was the only stipulation I had made prior to commencing the tour when I picked up that the itinerary hotel did not match the website hotel. After the Bwindi changes , I was assured that the hotels booked henceforth were correct. A 3 hr standoff ensued with Doreen initially stating that the resort name didn't exist and was an error on her website( this despite seeing her view it on booking.com at dinner the night before!). She tried to convince me that we were at the correct place( the names were similar) When shown their website and availability,  she continued to try and coerce me into staying there.Various reasons for the incorrect booking and not being able to book me into the original hotel were then givena late booking, reading the name incorrectly, no funds available, the manager refusing to refund her, etc.I even offered to pay for the booking and she refund me in Kampala, which she refused. Out of frustration I requested to cancel the rest of the tour and be taken back to Kampala that evening.She eventually relented and I was taken to the hotel on my booking.It was unfortunate that a refund of approx $40 spoilt what was supposed to have been an extraordinary day. Or that I had to waste precious time to get the 3rd of the 5 accommodations I had paid for.  

The positives remain the natural beauty of Uganda and the efforts  and knowledge of the tour guide and driver, Nelson.

Neeti,US,Visited: November 2018,04-Jan-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Bonfire Adventures,1,Horrible experience! Stay Away,"The guide Humphreys was disrespectful to stay the least. Our trip to Amboseli was the worse trip we have taken so far. It started with Humphreys coming late to pick us up at Nairobi and taking us via dirt road to Nairobi National park to ""pay"" some fees where he was turned down. We reached Amboseli late and the car broke down in the middle of the park! We were on a custom itinerary and we decided to meet at7:30 am and were having breakfast in the hotel. Humphrey claims that he came and was waiting but did not bother calling us. When we came out to the parking lot he was not there and his phone was not reachable. No-one in the hotel knew where he was either. He finally came and from the minute he came he started yelling at all of us (my husband, parents and in-laws) in front of the hotel staff for being late. He called us unprofessional several times in public and threw our luggage in the car. He cancelled our safari on his own without telling us and we came to know that only after we realized we were on our way to Nairobi. So much money paid for what?
When we came back to Nairobi and called the Bornfire office, initially they were sympathetic and agreed to look into the matter, and later sent us an email justifying each and every action of Humphrey and proved us wrong. Even the CEO was cc'ed in the email and we addressed an email to him and have not received a response. We have taken many trips to different part of the world, but this has been the absolute worse! Please please stay away unless you want to be humiliated."

The driver collected us at 7:30 an hour later than agreed and there was already 2 other passengers in the van. We were told we could have 1000kes discount on our price per person but then this was retracted. The game driver was finished by lunch time and we were back at out villa for 2:30pm. Huge disappointment as we didnt get to see all the animals and how they behave during different times of the day. Avoid this company at all costs. Dishonest, unreliable, overpriced, under delivered!

I booked a shared - mid range safari package - 4 nights 5 days. After sending the deposit ""to secure the accommodation"" a month prior to the trip - I did not hear back from the company until I arrived in Arusha. Gift came to my home to collect the rest of the payment the night before being picked up by Samuel our driver the next morning. The other 5 in the vehicle I would find out later were on different itineraries. After the first day I was told my accommodation had changed as the other people were in different m and mine was too far away. I was put in a different vehicle at the gate of the first Park to be given a lift to the first nights accommodation. Next morning I was picked up and we made our way to Serengeti. I was again told that ,y accommodation for night 2 was again different to what I had booked due to the distances between the groups' accommodation. Night 3 was in the camp I had booked. However day 4 in Ngorongoro Crater was cut short and we were heading out of the park at noon as the rest of the group were on 3 night 4 day itineraries and were due back in Arusha (with a family of 3 flying from JRO that evening ) So I lost 1/2 a day of Safari ( not to mention the hours lost driving around on a morning to the other accommodations. ) The final night was in my booked lodge as advertised and Gift came to the Lodge with another driver for my last day in Manyara. 
On return to Arusha I informed Gift about my displeasure at losing so much time - especially in Ngorongoro as it was wonderful there. No attempt to reimburse me was made for the lost time and changes to accommodation. 
A hugely disappointing experience as it was my first time on Safari and first time in Africa. 
The time in the vehicle with Samuel ( the driver ) and the other travellers was great and we saw lots of wildlife - but the whole experience was affected by the poor organisation. "

We had a good experience. The safari was enjoyable and I would definitely recommend that everyone visit this part of the world at some point. However, we had a terrible experience with our driver (a man named Mollel Martin Nguma) and the company after we returned returned home. A couple months after got back, the driver reached out via email to ask if we could extend him a small loan so that he could purchase a truck and start his own safari business. We obliged since he seemed like a hard working individual who did not have a lot of opportunities in Tanzania. But when the loan came due, the driver claimed that he had been the victim of identity fraud. We were initially open to the possibility. But it soon became apparent that his story was all a thinly veiled ruse designed to cover his tracks. In the end, we didn't lose a lot of money. But we were very disappointed with the way that Safari Care handled the matter. It wasn't their problem, they didn't care and this individual is still driving for them. A real company would make sure these sort of things don't happen. Go elsewhere and avoid the headache."

So I would have to pay myself again and for the driver and the car even though I had paid all inclusive. Up to yesterday the driver was calling me to say that he has not been paid yet if I could help, He even called me names once I called him in the afternoon and he was drunk.

Nick,US,Visited: September 2022,01-Oct-22,20-35,first safari,Seven Wonders Safaris,1,Completely Disorganized and No Transparency,"We booked a combined Kenya-Tanzania safari through Okoa Africa Safari (Kenya operator). We were dropped off at the border, and Seven Wonders picked up the Tanzania portion of our tour. 

We are experienced travelers who generally don¢®?t mind small hiccups or slight plan changes. However, we experienced many issues on this safari that were unacceptable. No matter what tour agency you select, you will see the animals and the landscapes. If you don¢®?t want those memories clouded by stress, uncertainty, and worry, pick a more reputable tour agency. This is not a professional outfit. 

We were dropped off at multiple locations that didn¢®?t match our provided itinerary with no Wi-Fi / service to contact the agency. In one instance, the next driver showed up 15 hours late. There was a lack of information and transparency that left us feeling unsafe, vulnerable, and stranded. 

A flat tire is reasonable and common. However, setting off on a three-day safari in the Serengeti with a damaged, leaking radiator is negligent and unsafe. We were stranded for two hours because the engine overheated and had to make several other stops to check on the vehicle throughout the tour. 

Despite paying for an all-inclusive (planned) safari, we had independent or sub-contracted drivers who were not aware of our itinerary ?including what parks we were to visit, where we were staying and the logistics of our next (unexpected) hand-offs. These drivers also didn¢®?t have our information and we were forced to trust they were somehow affiliated with the company.

In one specific incident, a driver had no idea what our final destination was or where we were staying. This driver attempted to pick up friends along the way until we demanded to be taken to our accommodation. He didn¢®?t know this accommodation, so we told him to take us to the accommodation we stayed in before we departed for the park where we knew we would have access to Wi-Fi to call for help. We then had to go to the new accommodation that was not on our provided itinerary.

Other issues we experienced:

1. Our accommodations didn¢®?t match those listed on our itinerary and we were never provided with an updated version. 
2. None of the jeeps were affiliated with Okoa Tours or the Tanzanian counterpart called Seven Wonders, despite other legitimate companies having branded vehicles. 
3. All jeeps¢®? were older than the pictures provided and the charging outlets did not work as described."
Nicola,BE,Visited: January 2016,14-Feb-16,35-50,2-5 safaris,Absolute Africa,2,Low low low budget,"I knew this was going to be a low budget trip. I have lived in Africa in several different countries for over 6 years. I am used to things not working, cold showers, camping and roughing it. What I did not know is that I would be hungry most of the trip because they don't have enough coolers to store food for breakfast and lunches. I also did not know that most of our days on the trip would be spent just driving and not really doing anything but looking out the window. In retrospect we could have spent about the same amount of money or just a little more seeing the gorillas and then flying from Rwanda or Uganda to Tanzania and also camping but having more days to see the Serengeti and Ngorongoro Crater. So many days were lost driving and spending time on a dirty bus, with very little food and 21 other people that were nice but that I did not necessarily want to spend 24hrs a day with doing nothing on a bus.

I would have planned the trip differently if I had to do it over again. Maybe if you are going from Nairobi to Cape Town this would be the trip for you. They do organize everything and you really get to see the real Africa on this bus. So, logistics are not something you ever have to worry about with this tour company and that is a nice thing.  Our guide and truck driver were so kind and helpful. 

Of course Africa, the safaris and gorillas were spectacular. I just wish we could have seen them and not felt so dirty and hungry the whole trip and also not wasted so many days driving with strangers that were nice but not going to be lifelong friends."
Nicole,DE,Visited: September 2018,13-Sep-18,20-35,first safari,Essenia Safari Experts,2,"Poor guides, poor itinerary, mechanical problems","My husband and I did a 2 week/3 country East Africa tour, and Essenia was responsible for 5 days in Tanzania. This portion of our trip really did not meet our expectations in any categoryitinerary, lodges, customer service and especially driver/guides. We had a lot of trouble communicating with our first guide. English comprehension problems meant we could not easily ask questions about the schedule, animals, or general cultural questions. During game drives we had a lot of trouble requesting him to stop in time to see animals, he did not know the birds or trees, and even misidentified a monkey as a species which doesn't live in Tanzania! After an upsetting first day of game drives, we asked to change guides. Essenia did not seem to take the problems very seriously, and we had to really push them to find someone else. 
The next day, our safari truck was leaking gas and we stopped at a garage to have it looked at. 40 minutes down the road the dashboard suddenly started smoking heavily. Just as we bailed out of the car, a call came that they had found a new driver and he was waiting for us with a different car an hour down the road - lucky timing, I am not sure what would have happened if we hadn't already requested a new guide! After a comedy of errors where we waited an hour for the new driver to pick us up while he waited for us to come to him, we flagged down a passing car from another company and hitchhiked to the new driver. Between morning delays to call customer service, mechanical issues and bad coordination we basically lost this entire day of our trip - quite frustrating. 
The new guide was better than the first one. I can say he was competent, but no where near the quality of driver/guides we had on other legs of the trip. For examplehe kept telling us stories about customers who tried to make requests which he thought were a bad idea (""tried to do his job of guiding"") and to show them that they were wrong, he would let them have a really bad experience (ie drive slowly and hit all the bumps on a road) until they apologized and begged him to do it his way after all. We tried to be careful not to upset him so that we didn't have an experience like that. 

We also had problems with the overall itinerary/planning, especially scheduling transit time in the morning when animals are more active and game drives in the mid afternoon heat when animals are there but not doing much. It turns out all 4 lodges were actually owned by the same hotel chain. Though they were nice properties, we would have preferred to experience more variety and local flavor - and not the same buffet for every breakfast/lunch box/dinner! These two issues I should have paid closer attention to before booking, when I could have asked for changes. Essenia never followed up with us directly during or after the trip. We did see lots of animals, there are plenty in Tanzania so we didn't feel this was due to any special skills of our guide. In summaryEssenia really let us down and I would strictly avoid doing business with them. "
Nigel,UK,Visited: November 2023,22-Nov-23,65+,first safari,Kima Safaris,1,Irresponsible; callous; unapologetic; indifferent to fact we paid for a service he could not deliver,"Sold safari itinerary that proved to be undeliverable.
Driven in land cruiser with several major defects, many of which were significant safety risks. 
The most harrowing part of the journey was during 14-hour drive from Makumi to Selous (which should have taken no more than 7 hours).
Just after 7pm on this drive, the headlights on the vehicle failed. It was dark and very remote where it happened. 
The road was potholed and riven (a truck had been stuck in the mud earlier and we had waited an hour while villagers dug it out before we could pass).
The driver resorted to holding his mobile phone out of the window in his right hand,to shine the light from his screen on to road.  His left hand held the wheel and he drove one-handed, with very little light from his phone, with hazard lights on.
The journey was completed agonisingly slowly in this dangerous one-handed fashion. 
Because of the rain, it was also hard to distinguish the road from water on both sides. 
We both thought we would die. 

The following day we saw Steven, the company owner, at the river safari where he was with a group (from the hotel where we had been staying).  He was in a more superior vehicle.  

We were rightly angry. We tried to tell him about some of our experience of the tour, but he offered not one word of sympathy, still less any apology or acceptance of responsibility. 

When  we said our lives had been endangered, he said we should take it as an adventure!  I am in my 70s and my wife is nearly 70.  We do not need this kind of adventure at this stage in our lives. We are well-travelled and had ¢®?slummed it¢®? in our twenties. 

 When my wife mentioned that the hand rail came off when she held on to it as the vehicle tipped at 45degrees going through a rut, Steven said that it was probably because of her weight!!!

We pointed out to him that it was his responsibility to provide us with a vehicle that was fit-for-purpose.  He responded that it was the rain that posed a problem to our journey having taken so long. 

This is just an account of the worst part of the tour. 

We bought a 4-day safari (84 hours) but spent spent a total of 31.5 hours travelling in the vehicle, with a mere 8 hours on actual safari in the two parks, Makumi and Selous. 

We paid USD1800 and were provided with an unroadworthy, not fit-for-purpose vehicle. 

The accommodation was changed at the last minute on the first day and we were put up in a place with no fan, air-conditioning or hot water.  

The accommodation at Selous did have a fan, but no hot water for a shower after our gruelling journey or for an early morning shower.  (They did provide hot water later in the day but no hot shower before our walking Safari before breakfast.)

It was a terrifying experience.

Clearly not value for money. "
Nora,US,Visited: August 2023,07-Aug-23,20-35,first safari,African Sermon Safaris,2,completely disorganized and made me feel unsafe,"African Sermon Safaris was completely disorganized and had no idea what they were doing. As a solo traveller, I felt unsafe and like I was going to be stranded somewhere. To start, the company gave me no information about my pick up until I asked them multiple questions. They also messed up my reservation and initially put me in the wrong tour, despite me confirming multiple times which tour I wanted to do. When the driver picked me up, he drove me to a random gas station in Nairobi where we waited for the jeep to take me to Masai Mara. The jeep never came, so we went back into the city center to find it. I also assumed everyone on my tour would be staying at the same camp as me and doing the same itinerary, but that wasn't the case. I was the only one out of the people on my tour to stay at my camp. I signed up for the budget tour, so I knew the camp wouldn't be anything fancy, but the camp wasn't gated and our tents didn't even have locks on them. Everyone who worked at the camp was very friendly, but there also wasn't electricity except for 3 hours a day. Anyways, after the first two game drives, the driver thought I was going to Nakuru the next day, but I was supposed to stay in Masai Mara, so they didn't tell me until the next morning who would be taking me on my game drive, since everyone else in my tour was either going back to Nairobi or to Nakuru. It turns out they completely switched which tour company I was with and I finished the rest of the tour with Jocky Tours (which was a much better tour FYI). Except African Sermon Safaris never even told me I was being switched companies -- I only found out from talking to others on the tour. I was supposed to go back to Nairobi the next morning, and they didn't tell me who was taking me until the next morning at 8am. Also, the company never told me. The woman who ran the camp was the one who coordinated my trip back to Nairobi. Anyways, I know all the companies and camps work together, but it felt extremely disorganized and I hated being passed between drivers and companies. In total, I had 6 different drivers throughout my 4 day trip. Even on my way back to Nairobi they had me switch into a different car, which would have been fine, but then they realized they messed up and put me back in the original car. I'm surprised I wasn't stranded somewhere/didn't end up in a different city. While I still had the time of my life on the safari, I would never book with African Sermon Safaris again. It was extremely stressful and the communication was terrible. "
NS,IL,Visited: January 2018,03-Mar-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Solaris Tours and Safaris,1,"Amazing Kenya, and the SOLARIS the FRAUDSTERS","This is a genuine review about our trip (me & my husband) to Kenya during last month (5 days, End of January 2018).
Hope this will help you, if Kenya is in your bucket list also.
Kenya is an amazing place, with its scenic places, very friendly people, tasty food and the best tea.
There are many tour operators available online, please start doing the research a bit early and go for a reputed one.
I contacted many tour operators but got impressed with Solaris quotes and their flexibility which made us to choose them. The only and the biggest mistake I did in planning this trip. Now after the trip I understand, being flexible to any extend is the trick to make you fall for them. 
The coordinator and the spokesperson from Solaris was Josphat.
Here is the list of disappointments by the Great Solaris!!
?	Starting of our trip - Josphat cancelled the Amboseli NP plan without informing us. When we got ready with lot of excitement in the morning the driver took a turn towards Nairobi and said that you flight was delayed so the Amboseli NP is cancelled. We were shocked to hear this as we landed on time and got out of the airport as well on time, it was a lie told by Josphat to the driver.
               We travelled all the way from Nairobi to Amboseli just to sleep in the Lodge...!!!!!!!!  I must say the Kilimanjaro view we had from our lodge was spectacular, which kind of calmed us down. 
And on second day travelling all the way from Amboseli to Lake Nakuru...
We reached late to Nakuru also...!!!!!!! 2 days wasted in our 5 days trip...!!!!!!!
Refund Number 1: Mr. Josphat then agreed to give us back the National park entr?e ticket fee.

?	We were provided with a safari van, which had a non-working radio. Only after reaching Masai Mara we got to know the importance of radio. The guides communicate to others over wireless when they spot something.
Our driver knew this radio issue from day one and he did not open his mouth until we were stuck inside Mara with no radio. If driver and Josphat had communicated properly, they could have fixed/replaced the radio when we had crossed Nairobi on the second day from Amboseli.  But they did nothing...!!!!
We got to see the big 5, only because we were lucky...!!!!!!!

?	The driver hardly opened his mouth and he is supposed to be the experienced safari guide too for us. He was more like just a driver who had already reached his retirement age. Every day we started on time, but never reached any destination on time...!!!!
He was very careless and sometimes rude too and never cared about our time.
Example,
After balloon safari (on the 4th day) he was supposed to pick us inside Mara at the agreed upon spot.  When we returned he was already waiting there for us, but as soon as we got in, he said ¢®¡ÆI don¢®?t see your lunch box inside and this hotel guys have forgotten to put it¢®¡¾, We had to go all the way to the camp from the national park to take the lunch box and after reaching there it turned out that it was in the vehicle all the time and he did not check it properly and just started blaming camp guys. This event made both of us very upset on for first wedding anniversary morning. First of all it is his job to make sure the lunch boxes are in before he leaves the camp and he did not care to check that while waiting on the spot for us too. Then at last he can¢®?t search his own van.

Because of his carelessness we lost almost 2 hours in the morning, the time when we get to see more games.

Refund Number 2: For all the disappointments, Mr. Josphat wanted to correct his mistake by refunding some amount on the next day of our trip end.

Even after a month, follow up with lot of patients, we got zero Refunds!!!!
After one month, we did not receive any money, which explains us that was not a flaw which happened accidently, but all the plans and promises were just lies to get our booking.
When we are spending so much, his refund is not a big money. But still we wanted to give him a chance to admit and correct his mistakes.
So, guys after spending so much money, so much researching, expectations and planning, if you don¢®?t want to end up with a feeling of being cheated, DON'T GO WITH SOLARIS.
Only 35 reviews in all these years tell what SOLARIS really is...
 In spite of all these, it will still be a special trip with the magical view of Mt.Kilimanjaro in Amboseli, Flamingoes in the Lake Nakuru, Masai village visit, balloon safari and the big 5 safari in Masai Mara .
It would have been a lifetime trip if we would have chosen another tour. If we get a chance we definitely want to go back to Kenya, but definitely not with SOLARIS.

Olivia,IT,Visited: August 2014,18-May-17,20-35,first safari,Meru Mountain Treks & Safaris,1,Ibrahim the monster,"I don't recommand meru treks at all frist of all the boss Ibrahim he's an asshole I would even say worse but I'll stay polite. It's an horrible person. We booked a 2 days safari with him for 280?©¡ which extremely cheap, he was really nice friendly and professional at the beginning, so we were so happy to get a safari that cheap that we asked him if we could book a excursion to see the waterfalls, to do the coffee tour and to see the kilimanjaro. He said sure it's going to be 30?©¡ more he said we'll take you from your place to the montain. We thought we were going by car obviously so we said yes . So the day after we were supposed to go at 7:30 no one came. We waited and called him he said the guide he's comming. And at 9am so 1:30 late 2 guides came and one of them was drunk and we were supposed to have only one guide. We told the drunk one to leave we went with the other one. And after 5min in car to get to the city centrer he told us that we were going to take the public transports to moshi which is at 2hours from arusha we were so angry because we paid to not take the public transports we could have done it ourselves. When we arrived in moshi we had to take another daladala to get to the mountain and we waited 1hour for the daladala to leave moshi and the guide was smoking talking to his friends so unprofessional. So basically we left at 9am to arrive at the place at 2pm. So we did the visit it was cool but the guide made us rush because he didn't want to miss the last dalala to get back to moshi so we couldn't take our time and enjoy. At the end obviously we missed the last daladala and the guide who was supposed to pay us everything didn't have enough money to pay for the motorbikes to take us to moshi so we had to pay. When we arrive in moshi we spend an hour in the street waiting for him to find money walking around the city to pay the bus to arusha, it was 8pm. Organisation 0 ! And then he finally got the money and we took the bus to Arusha and arrived at 10pm and we had the safari the day after at 7:30 am we didn't even have time to eat. My friend and I were so pissed off then we decided to complain to the boss. So we went to the office before going on safari. And ibrahim's real face appears, we talk to him very politely and he started shouting on us he got crazy he didn't even let us speak he had an answer for everything and he started saying ""if you complain for that you're going to complain for the safari so don't go"" we were so angry because we wanted to do the safari still but we had to complain about the day before because it was horrible. So he started to take off our bags from the car of the safari and he kept shouting waiting for us to apologise but we didn't, fortunately the driver was great and told him to let us go so we went on safari. Do you imagine 30?©¡ for that ! And he didn't give us the money back obviously. But fortunately the driver joseph was amazing and the safari went well and we saw all the animals. So the 1 star I put is only for the safari and because at least it was cheap. But if you can avoid this company avoid it and especially Ibrahim this monster shouting on two 21 years old girls when he is the on who is wrong."
Olivia,CH,Visited: December 2016,08-Jan-17,20-35,first safari,Bonfire Adventures,1,Dishonest and Disorganised,"We booked with Bonfire Adventures for a 3 day trip to Mara Maasai and after our experience would not recommend Bonfire Adventures for the following reasons.

1. Disorganised. 
Bonfire were highly disorganised. I felt as if I was doing most of the organisation and I was trying to organise their agent to book things for us. I had to repeatedly follow up with them about if they had made the booking and what time we would be collected to start the Safari. They only confirmed who was collecting us at 7pm the night before we were due to leave at 7am the next morning. They asked us to let the driver know where to collect us from even though we had already provided them with that information more than a week in advance. 

2. Dishonesty
We asked them for a quote as to the cost, which they provided to us. It wasn't until after we paid that they informed us that they had quoted us the residents rate rather then non-residents rate and would have to pay more money. I have a very English first and surname so I have no idea why they would assume that I was a resident. They then said that I should have known that it was the residents rate as they had charged us in the local currency rather then US dollars. I asked them to return my money to me as I did not want to pay extra as this would make the safari significantly more expensive. It was only at this point they said that they could actually offer it to us at the residents rate. 

Perhaps more disappointing was that they were dishonest with money. I sent them the money for the Safari and paid the bank fees. According to my calculations I unintentionally underpaid them 700 KES (Approx. 7 USD) due to the different the conversion rates.  However Bonfire said that I had underpaid them by 5,600 KES (Approx. 53 USD). When I questioned this they said the difference must be due to bank fees. I went back and checked that and in fact I had already paid these fees. I asked for further proof of exactly how much they received in the transfer but they only provided an internal spreadsheet, but nothing from their bank. I have asked them to provide me with a way to pay the remaining 700 KES and am waiting to hear back from them.  

3. Driver
The driver was also disappointing as at the end of our Safari we were dropped off at Lake Naivasha. He put pressure on us to pay him to drive us back to Nairobi after we were finished at the lake in a few days time. He asked us to pay him $120,000 KES and told us that we wouldn't get anyone to drive us back to Nairobi for less then $100,000 KES. We phoned a great driver we had previously used in Nairobi who immediately suggested a much more reasonable price of 70,000 KES and didn't pressure us at all to go with him.

They also ask to do a client feedback form which you then return to the staff who you are assessing so its difficult to give honest and open feedback in these circumstances."
Olivier,CR,Visited: October 2019,12-Dec-19,50-65,2-5 safaris,Rafiki Tours and Travel,1,INCOMPETENCE / DIRT / LIE / ILLEGALITY,"We just come back from a 19-day safari organized by Rafiki Safari Tours.
The organization was done by Elie, and our guide was the boss of this Cie : Joseph.
We had opted for a private safari mainly in Namibia, but that also took us to some border parks in South Africa, Bostwana and we ended up in Zimbabwe to admire the Victoria Falls. It must have been a mixed safari lodges and campsites.
Our guide had to organize breakfasts, lunches and dinners. It was the contract established.
I will now develop the topics :
LIES :
About the lodges. In fact, we only had 4 nights out of 19 in lodges ! they had the nerve to describe a campsite as a lodge while there was not even a bathroom, just a bucket to shower with cold water ! So, slight scam at this level.
The lunches for their part were often limited to a salad of rice / tomatoes taken along the road or on makeshift parking. Dinners were often Polenta.
During our stays in campsites, our guide took us away from amenities and inputs, because he suffers from a serious relationship problem. In fact, we still wonder why he does this job (well, just for the money ?) because he can¢®?t stand people.
The organization was disastrous because everything was done at the last minute. Excursions with taxis to get us across the border, a considerable time lost waiting, apparently our guide didn¢®?t have permits to transport tourists, no insurance either, fortunately we didn¢®?t have accident !
DIRT :
Total Lack of hygiene (thankfully, we got vaccins for everything), because the first night, we were surprised to note that our guide had not even provided a sleeping bag or even a sheet (once again, as we are used to travel, we had sleeping bags). About blankets !!! They have certainly never been cleaned, indescribable stains were still there. The mattresses were torn and the tent was leaking ! Our guide forgot the hat that allowed him to be waterproof.
To keep the food, just a little cooler of 20 liters max, often without ice, enthroned in the car. The utensils themselves were rusty and of another age. Folding chairs also torn, rusted and really dirty. We even finished the last 4 days without a table because our guide had ""forgotten"" it.
INCOMPETENCE:
At the beginning of our stay our guide made a huge mistake : We were in Kgalagadi Park and he described the jackal as a feline. A detail, certainly, but that was repeated dozens of times daily, throughout the stay and on many points, so dint of hearing wrong things, we left it spoken, referring us to the internet to have the real information. When we pointed out his mistake, he spent the whole evening searching on the internet to prove the opposite. But in front of his ineptness, he left and shunned the whole evening ! We laughed of him because it was so ridiculous, as a little child. We felt that our presence weighed him down and that he was doing his job just for the photos he could take and post on social networks ! Totally childish behavior, more often on the internet, even while driving, a real danger.
ILLEGALITY :
As I said at the beginning of this message, a contract had been established. But as soon as we started to report the first problems, our guide bawled us squarely, even in public, several times in lodges. Imagine shame for us. And then, he blamed the organizer, asking us to contact him. What I did as soon as the connections allowed us. The latter asking us to solve our problems with the guide. In fact, you will understand, they blame themselves, but when you know they are like partners, it was ridiculous.
But the worst was when our guide abandoned us, we can say that, at the 1st border post between Botswana and Zimbabwe. As I said, everything was tricky, and he was always looking for taxis at the last minute. But this day, impossible for him to find someone, he had no desire to finish the journey with us, but I must say that it was a little reciprocal. Then he saw a professional guide coming home to Namibia, whom he asked to pick us up because he had just left his own clients in Victoria Falls. This guy accepted very nicely and we finished our journey with him. But what a mistake for Rafiki Safari Tours, because our new guide of fortune explained us what we would never have to know: all the norms and especially all the necessary authorizations to work on these different countries (Namibia, Botswana, Zimbabwe, etc. ). And of course, our guide Joseph, was apparently in total illegality. What would it be like if we had an accident with him ? How is it possible to work by making fun of and being so uncomfortable with one's own customers ?
Finally we had to finish our tour at Katima Mulilo, where we had to take a sleeper bus to get back to Windhoek. But of course, nothing was booked and it's normal, because we learned that this bus line has not existed for at least a year ! Of course, we have not been refund for this, as the last free meals, yet at the expense of Rafiki Safari tours according to the contract. When I made a complaint, Elie, the organizer insulted me by calling me arrogant !
CONCLUSION :
This company, its leader and its organizer, are a total rip-off, pure amateurs incompetent, without real knowledges. But as you will understand, we traveled in dirty conditions with a person who has big psychological problems. Elie, the organizer told us ! he came to see us the last night to try to calm our anger, but did nothing more than show us the new company (illegal surely) he had just updated, to separate soon from the owner. Even between them, they lack frankness and honesty, so how could they work properly? 
I am actually spreading my discontent, because i DO NOT want that anyone to be abused as we were. We have already contacted all relevant authorities, including the Namibian Tourism Board on which Rafiki Safari Tours is not registered of course.
So, have a wonderful stay in these beautiful lands, but avoid this company, and the people mentioned. Others are professional, not them !

So we spent half of the day just trying to fix it! And the guide was so relaxing and ""hakuna matata"", he did not apologise for us and he worked very slowly. 
So in the end we fixed one of the flat tires!
It was really bad experience. When I came back from the safari so the manager asked ""how was the safari"" and I said ""that it was not good and I want to talk with you"" he just said ok and than he just gone and I could not talk with him!

We have Good Luck as our driver/guiding, and I must say he wasn¢®?t knowledgeable at all! I found myself reading from Wikipedia all the time to know a little bit more about what I¢®?m seeing because it¢®?s not just about seeing the animals it¢®?s learning about them too.
Also, his English wasn¢®?t clear at all.
In addition to that, he barely knew where the camps are and even didn¢®?t know how to build a tent, told us that it¢®?s his first time sleeping in a camp, although he said that he is doing safaris for already three years. Go figure it out. 

Also, the camp equipment was poorly; I expected to have better chairs for eating. We were the only group that has this kind of chairs. Also, the sleeping bags were disgusting, and their zippers we're broke, so we freeze at night in the Ngorongoro National Park. 

The only thing that I can't say that was good is the fact that we had Emanuel as our chef. My wife I and I are vegans, so he made us delicious food and also functioned as our guide when he joins us once to the game drive. 

So, unfortunately, I must say, stay away from that safari company!"
Oscar,NL,Visited: August 2023,07-Nov-23,35-50,first safari,Honcho DMC,1,A Ruined Honeymoon Safari: Expectation vs. Reality,"I hesitated before writing this review, not because I doubted the validity of my complaints, but because I was so angered and disappointed right after our trip that I feared my emotions might cloud my judgment. Now, with some time passed and my sentiments cooled, I believe it's crucial to share our experience honestly and openly. When posting this, my anger and frustration is again boiling up....something I have never had before. 

Our honeymoon was meant to be memorable, and indeed it will be, but for all the wrong reasons. We booked a three-day, two-night safari full of promise and excitement. The itinerary was detailed, and the experiences it described were dreamlike. However, our dreams were quickly dashed upon arrival. The first day, a highlight and crucial part of our adventure, was completely lost. What should have been our introduction to the wonders of the safari?a game drive, followed by a magical lunch on the steppe?was nothing more than a simple transit from the airstrip to our camp for lunch. The game drives? Nonexistent. The lunch on the steppe? Replaced by a mundane meal inside the restaurant at the camp, whereby we also got the question what we wanted to do. One of the main reasons for booking Honcho was the detailed itinerary, so it was super frustrating that all of a sudden we had to figure out what the plan should be. We pointed to the itinerary, but since  we had already deviated so much, it could not be resolved anymore on the first day, which completely ruined that day... We paid $6000 for a 3 day trip, so losing one day, is just unacceptable.

The frustration was further fed when we had our first of many encounters over an issue as trivial as drink charges. Despite being assured that all beverages were included?indeed, this was confirmed several times in our itinerary? we got the message during our lunch inside the restaurant that they weren't included. Only after a heated discussion on the phone, thereby pointing to the itinerary which stated multiple times that drinks were included, they agreed to this. 

Though our second day did include a lunch on the steppe, it was overshadowed by the previous day's disappointment and a continued discussions about drink charges... We had to advocate for ourselves repeatedly, an unnecessary stressor during what was supposed to be a relaxing retreat into nature.

Our final day brought the culmination of our grievances. After days of back-and-forth, the unresolved issues with the drink charges peaked again during our last game drive. Rather than savoring our final moments with the rhino's, we were again embroiled in a heated debate over the phone. Honcho had called our driver, asked him to put them through and they again started debating the drink charges... Honcho's representative not only failed to offer any apologies but also managed to ruin our last hours on safari by insisting we deal with a matter that we had been told was already settled.

But if you think the discussion ended there.... No it didn't. Upon arrival back at the airstrip for our hotel (Diani Beach), we were supposed to be picked up by a taxi, but there was no driver. Honcho had given the wrong information to the taxi, so we first ended up waiting before taking our own taxi. After finding out, Honcho instructed the taxi driver who would pick us up to go to our resort and offer apologies, which he did. But, he also gave me the phone and then somebody from Honcho started talking. He did make an apology for the taxi, but of course I was expecting an apology for all other things that had went wrong. Instead he again began a discussion about the drinks!!! So, then I hang up, again feeling frustrated and angry.

The troubles didn't end with poor communication or administrative errors; there was also a distinct lack of the small touches that were supposed to make our honeymoon special. The promised chocolates and tropical fruits? Never seen. And let's not forget the advice of our guide, in hindsight, about booking a camp inside the reserve for a more immersive experience?advice that came too late and only highlighted what we had missed out on due to a lack of transparency and proper guidance from Honcho. Our camp was situated about an hour and a half drive away from the park, thereby wasting precious time we could have spent inside the park enjoying wildlife. 

In closing, not once were we offered a sincere apology, nor was there any attempt at a gesture to make amends for the multiple failings. Instead, we were met with deflection, blame-shifting, and an utter lack of accountability. This was not the dream honeymoon safari we had envisioned and paid handsomely for. It was a lesson in how a lack of customer care and service can turn a dream trip into a series of frustrating events that we are now eager to forget.

I share this not out of a lingering anger, but in the hopes that our story can serve as a cautionary tale for others seeking to embark on a safari adventure. The wild is unpredictable, yes, but the service around it shouldn't be."

Hi Fred,
I am providing to you a feedback about our travel.
We have been usually travelling to different Africa countries, and we have experiences with other tour companies.
The Itinerary were quite good, wildlife, community interactions, activities, natural parks, treekings, etc.
Eddie is a good chauffeur-driver, nice person, but not a tourist guide. He is mute, any explanations, not interesting information about Uganda. For instance, when I lost my mobile phone he rejected to call me to make the phone ring, etc.
Sandton Hotel in Kasese
?	room was not ready when we arrived around 13:00
?	small room with two individual beds (see picture attached).
?	No tap water in whole day.
¢®?and finally we had to look for other lodge by ourselves without any compensation or reimbursement from your side.
Too wicked and ugly to make us pay breakfast first day.
We experienced 2 days with long car drive, leaving  around 7:00-7:30 and arriving lodge around 16:00-16:30 without stops for lunch with my daughter starving (just to fill up the tank), and pack lunch either despite our suggestions to pick up one.
Original 2Friends Beach Hotel for last day changed by other lower category, without swimming pool, 
No dinner covered last day despite all meals were included in the proposal.
No air conditioning in the car the last 5 days.
No water available last day, and we had to buy it.
Early mornings wake up (no problem) but some days arriving to the next lodge also early 15:00-16:00 without any activity in the evening (waste of time).
We did 1 hour quad instead 4 hours as stated in the itinerary.
In the contract it informed it was full meals, but we had to pay breakfast first day and dinner last day.
We are very sorry to say EAJS has not reached our expectations and it has been a disappointment. We should search other alternatives for our 2023 travel to Rwanda. 
We can¢®?t recommend it to any of our family and friends plan to travel to Africa and we hope our critics help you make it better.
Best regards,

Ove S,NO,Visited: February 2020,31-May-20,35-50,over 5 safaris,Tafika Travel Advisor,1,"The guys and the bosses were nice enough, but logistically it was a disaster.","The communications were not good because the contact person were offline due to him being working in areas with low internet coverage, but answered when he had internet available.

We ordered 3 transfers, Harare- Vic Falls, Vic Falls- Livingstone and Livingstone- Lusaka. 

Due to the company based in Zambia mixed the dates they hired a Zimbabwe based company to do Harare- Vic Falls. They came late,
drove a 14 hour ride instead of the 7 hour we ordered and demanded us to pay black marked fuel price at 50% higher cost because they had bought it at the black market. Then we understood why they drove the 14 hour route, they could charge more fuel at 50% higher price. I believe they payed the normal fuel price. (This was the Zimbabwe based company they hired.)

We stayed in Vic Falls for 2 nights, then the Zimbabwe guys should drive us to the border dropping us off and be picked up by Tafika travels in Zambia. By this time Tafika and the Zimbabwe based guys had started to fight over the the payment between them, and they didnt want to drive us before Tafika payed them. And my desperate messages to Tafika about our problem werent answered. We had already pre- payed all transfers, so we refused to pay the 800$ the guys demanded from us. 

To be fair, our total payement was 960$ for 3 transfers, so the demand for 800$ for 1 transfer was redicilous, but that should have been agreed between them before the transfer, and not become our problem 5 minutes before the original departure leaving us with no transfer between the 2 countries. 

The reason for using 2 companies was that we headed for Vic Falls february 9th, but the day before we understood Tafika thought we were going the wednesday 3 days later. So Tafika hired theese guys for the first half of our trip since they had no cars able to pick us up at 1 day notice. The mixed dates mentioned above.

We ended up with paying a local driver money to bring us to Livingstone, Zambia. There we met eventually the driver from Tafika. He was very nice, but had a car to small for our luggage. We ordered a car for 5 persons with luggage (5 suitcases + small bags), but the car could take 1 or 2 suitcases in the trunk. We had to pay 50$ extra for sending the luggage by bus, but only 2 out of 5 came to the hotel so 3 of us had no luggage half the Lusaka stay.

We demanded a refund for the Vic Falls- Livingstone transfer and the 50$ extra luggage cost and were told we should get that back.

After 3 months of waiting we have got only promises but no refund. My last question about the refund werent even answered. That makes me writing this review giving a 1 star. I dont like doing it since the guys were very nice and also promised a refund, but 3 after 3 months I give up."
Oyndrila,QA,Visited: July 2018,05-Aug-18,20-35,first safari,Tour Kenya Safari Heights,1,Terrible experience while on the 7 day tour.,"I had been approached by Tour Kenya Safari Heights owner Meshak Mutinda like many other tour operators when I had submitted a quote on Safari Bookings for my visit to Kenya for the Safari in March 2018.I had mentioned to my tour operator that I wanted Ole Moran in Masai Mara for my 2 days stay,Flamingo Lodge in Lake Nakuru on my One night stay and Kibo Safari Camp for 2 nights stay.He showed me the booking vouchers and asked rather begged to make the deposit of 300usd in the first week to April saying these hotels would be booked as July is a peak Season.He promised to provide for my first and last night stay in Nairobi and also visit to the elephant and giraffe centre on the last day.My tour was from 12th July 2018 until 19th July 2018.He offered me Sunrise Hotel on my first day of stay in Nairobi to which I had denied(after receiving bad feedback from friends) as it is not a nice hotel inspite of 3 star ratings.Meshak promised to provide another hotel however on the day of arrival in Nairobi he put us up there saying all the rest were full.
Next day en route to Masai Mara the driver John informed mid way that we are not putting up in Ole Moran(which is way closer to the park)but Nature Explore lodge which is 45min.drive away from the main gate entrance.So basically you waste at least an hour to enter.On speaking to Meshak the excuses started that Ole Moran is full etc.As per the itinerary he did not even provide for the next day early morning drive as he would have to pay for the entrance again.Same happened in Lake Nakuru and Amboseli they kept on changing the hotel.In Nakuru the hotel was good 45min drive from the gate entrance hence we waste another hour just to enter.In Amboseli as well AA lodge where we put up was still decent however on our 2 day stay we only got to visit the park on the first day and second day early morning drive was not provided as per the itinerary and we were asked to pay for it.Overall on the entire journey the driver John tried to savour money from us.He also took 35usd pp for the Masai Village entrance fee by lieing to us to fill his own pocket.Not to mention on our last day arrival in Nairobi no stay was provided and we had to book on our own.I had agreed on 1150usd pp on private tour for 2 and Tour Kenya Safari Heights failed to keep up to his word.We were scared that we would be left in the middle of the road anytime by our driver.Also on talking to the owner I only get excuses.There are many of these agencies trying to get money out of you by making false promises so please don't fall prey.We don't want anyone else to suffer like we did.So please make your own booking be it more or paying less money through booking com or Agoda or the hotel directly and arrange for your own transportation.We are lucky that we got to see the animals and the Safari was somewhat decent.But throughout we were scared that we might not see what we have paid for."
OZo,US,Visited: August 2019,05-Dec-19,35-50,2-5 safaris,Africa Flash Mc Tours & Travel,2,Needs improvement,"The Masai Mara is an incredible place with incredible animals and landscapes. Peter was excellent at communicating with us in a timely manner to answer all our questions and set up our itinerary for our safari trip. 
However we were not satisfied with the behavior of our driver who tried to convince us to enter and exit the park at the times we suggested. We think he was doing this in order to avoid paying the park fees for one day (each entry fee is valid for 24 hours). However we wanted to have as much time as possible in the park, as per what we had paid for, and in accordance with park timings. When we asked to stay in the park a bit longer than the time the driver was suggesting, he proceeded to avoid driving us out of the park through the main gate and instead drove us off track and trespassed through the Masai village at high speed. There were small children on the path and adult men and women (who carry sticks) started yelling at our van and throwing stones as the driver sped through. This was extremely embarrassing for us, as well as dangerous, as it was very dark and there were small children in the way.
Then the driver stopped and a man who seemed to be a Masai chief entered our car and spoke to our driver the entire way back to our hotel. We don't know what they negotiated or what they were talking about, since we don't speak their language and our driver wasn't communicating anything with us. 
We hope Flash McTours will work on improving their services. This kind of experience is not conducive for a pleasant safari experience. It is unsafe and likely to make your visitors feel very nervous and uncomfortable. Furthermore, 
It is essential that safari companies follow park rules and regulations and respect the Masai community, and their land. "
Pablo,ES,Visited: August 2023,12-Sep-23,20-35,first safari,African Breeze Tours,2,several setbacks that have occurred during the Safari.,"On Monday the 13th, ten minutes after departing in the van from Nairobi, Catherine, an employee and intermediary of African Breeze Safari, informed us that we were beginning the safari in a different order without prior consultation with us. Furthermore, she mentioned that there was no availability at the hotel we had booked (AA Lodge Masai Mara) as she had not made the reservations yet. The contract explicitly states that we were required to pay 25% in advance to reserve the hotels (Payment made on June 2, 2023). Despite this, we were accommodated in Masai Mara Camp, which was significantly different from where we had paid to stay. We didn't have water for personal hygiene and had to purchase bottled water with our own money for brushing our teeth and even showering.

Additionally, we didn't have breakfast on the two days we stayed because the camp didn't have enough food for all the people accommodated. Two of our companions even had to share a room despite having paid for individual rooms due to lack of available space.

Due to the aforementioned issues, from the first night, we contacted Catherine in an attempt to find solutions and prevent the situation from worsening. However, instead of helping, she sent a message saying, and I quote, ""please focus on positivity so you can enjoy your Safari.""

As I mentioned earlier, we booked this safari 3-4 months in advance, paying 25% upfront to reserve the hotels. Therefore, this should have been arranged and resolved well in advance.

I would also like to note that none of the guides had our itinerary. On August 15th, we were supposed to have lunch at Nakuru Sopa Lodge, a hotel we had already paid for, but instead, we had lunch on the way at a self-service restaurant that was nothing like where we were supposed to eat. We arrived at the hotel at 8:00 PM, leaving us only time to have dinner and sleep before leaving the next day, not being able to make the most of its facilities (which is the reason we paid for good hotels, to enjoy the safari and also relaxation).

We informed our guide (Sam) about this incident, and he mentioned that he was unaware since he didn't even have the itinerary.

The following day, the Lake Nakuru safari was rushed and completed within an hour. We didn't have time to enjoy the morning and couldn't even open the roof of the car to better appreciate the views, as it was broken. Not to mention the multiple breakdowns of the car, which required several stops to fix.

On the same day, we stopped at a shopping center to eat, paying for everything ourselves, as the picnic mentioned in the guide was once again not available."
Paolo Petrillo,IT,Visited: December 2017,31-Jan-18,35-50,first safari,Tanzania,1,A Safari without animals,"Serengeti park was absolutely empty, during our two days.
When I asked to change area the guide told us to be patient and that animals would have come. But when and where?! 
He also told us that moving trough other areas was too far, but we had to spend 6 hours per day into the park, so too far for what.
I am sorry but I spent 600USD for nothing. "
PARK,DE,Visited: August 2016,18-Sep-16,35-50,first safari,Ancient Wild Safaris,1,Not recommendable,"It occurs to me quite clear that this travel agency has very little inflence to the guide, who normally works as a freelancer. Don't fully believe agency's word, once payment is being made and hit the road, only person you could argue or meet is a guide whose working relationship with agency is quite limited. 

We've got confirmations of many things from this agency before we made a reservation, only few were true. Every day, guide were showed-up late, travelers were being instructed to take different vans every day or every trip, usually up to 7~9 people on one van which made people quite cramped. 
Drinking water were provided, as promised, but at first day for 3~4 days, therefore every trip and acommodation we heaved heavy weight luggages along with given bottle of waters. 
At Masaimara, accommodation were overbooked and moved to another camp which provide no water and no electricity inside the tented camp. Notwithstanding, no one felt sorry about it although some of the traveller contended heavily. 
Guide was less likely acting as a guide but more like a boss or merely driver. Almost zero explanation was given regarding the schedule.
Unnecessary detour or idle time happened due to the fact that groups all had different itenery. 
Kenya itself was amazingly nice place but my trip was degraded by all abovementioned facts.
It might be impoved if you select private tour.

Pat,BE,Visited: February 2022,29-Mar-22,65+,2-5 safaris,SG Tanzania Tours and Safaris,1,Terrible expierence,"On the advice of an acquaintance, we booked a 12-day safari directly with this Tanzanian operator.
The trip was more expensive than through a Belgian agency, but this would be offset by a more personal service.
However, the safari vehicle (a Toyota Landcruiser) was worn out and had to be pushed every morning to start. The wheels turned out to be attached to the axles with only two instead of five bolts and a footboard had to be welded along the way. Repairs cost us almost two days of delay.
The choice of lodges was also substandard. In one case without water or electricity, in another case we had to make our suitcases in the light of our flashlight.
The program was also changed without notice so that we were forced to pack unexpectedly quickly to change lodges.
The food was generally okay but the driver/guide (Patrick) considered the safari his personal private trip. Armed with a Canon camera with 600mm telephoto lens, he idiosyncratically toured to create his photo book. Our questions and demands were ignored¢®? well, the trip was pre-paid and we were totally dependent on him anyway.
His driving style was at times life-threatening. On a muddy track, he reached speeds of 100 km/h where the maximum speed was 50 km/h.
The negative highlight was the beautiful descent to the Ngorongoro crater. That happened in a closed vehicle with windows that were opaque due to mud.
Our Serengeti trip was ruined to a large extent by guide Patrick. The tour operator was not at all interested in our criticism at the end of the ride.
An advice ? Book through an official agency in your own country. With a Tanzanian company you have no defense whatsoever, despite all the good intentions of acquaintances."

Thanks to peter for refunding us the cost of our first day's travel as promised

** ORIGINAL REVIEW
We booked transport from Nairobi airport to Masai Mara for 7.30am dept time so we could do an afternoon game drive. We left nairobi 8 hours late at 3:30 pm having waited all day and arrived at 9:30pm and missed entirely one of our two days of game drives. We were given continued excuses over and over again and several requests for money en route for expenses etc. We had paid upfront and in full. This company almost ruined the entire trip. Thankfully we had independently booked great accommodation who provided their own good driver and guide for our game drive the next day. This company is not anywhere near good enough and should be avoided at all costs. They have promised a refund but continuously have deferred about paying this."
Patrick,FR,Visited: January 2020,28-Oct-20,35-50,2-5 safaris,Tekko Tours and Travel,1,Horrible experience with the guide Stephen !!!,"On the day of our arrival in Nairobi, the guide was over 1.5 hours late at the airport. Then we had to walk and wait another time 20 minutes because he had parked his car outside the airport parking lot. 
Barely on the road leaving for our safari he stopped to fill up with gasoline (couldn't he do it before picking us up when we had 12 hours of theft in our legs?).

On the way he said to us ""why are you coming when it is raining?"" January is not a good time to come (contrary to what we can read on the net).
Are we responsible for the weather? He replied that we had to call before coming! How then to organize a 15-day trip with hotels planes...


Finally at the arrival of the 1st park (Tsavo) before doing our 1st game drive, he asks us if we can take 4 people (Poles I believe) with us because they have a problem with their Jeep. To that we answer no because a little tired of his attitude and not to mention that we had arranged a private safari just for the 2 of us. Suddenly he does not like much and it was the climbing ...

He didn't like to repeat himself (we are not specialists in the animal world and even less English speakers) and allowed himself to think about us or downright hikes of your ""I already told you!"" Style. or ""Close the open roof now and don't discuss!""

I forgot ... We had a problem with the police because he had not updated his car insurance (3 hours to wait at the police station)
His Jeep did not have the 4 * 4 system either (supposedly broken on the way) and he had lent his tools (shovel and bars) which would have helped us to get out of a stuck in the mud instead. we had to clear it by hand. After getting dirty, no thank you from him ... In short, a horrible experience with this guide probably close to retirement age and who did not want to take this tour but are we responsible for it?

No compensation or commercial gesture on the part of Tekko tour despite the kindness of Carole with whom I was in contact for the organization.

Finally one thing shocked me: the guide lied about the number of game-drives made by his replacement (a freelance massai) who was not paid as he should. I learned about it a few months later and I made a complaint by mail and the problem was resolved without Tekko Tour ever acknowledging their fault.

And only one night in the Serengeti instead of promised 2. The last night I insisted to the driver to take me to Planet Lodge the last night on a hunch and it was so wonderful there I stayed there an extra night and I just dared them to make me move, which they did not.

Paula,TZ,Visited: November 2018,26-Nov-18,20-35,first safari,Faustin Tour and Travel,1,Unprofessional and disappointing,"We did a really bad experience with the Tour of faustin Tours and Travel.
We tried to get any confirmations on payments and an invoice before we went on the safari which already turned out very difficult as Faustin obviously doesn¢®?t like to confirm anything.
The First day everything Went well, we went hiking that was very nice. After that we drove in our Hotel. The tan Swiss Hotel which was nice. In the evening we Should pay the half of the Money Cash to our guide in the Hotel. 
In this Moment we noticed that money from us have been stolen. 
We¢®?re not sure where it happens either it was in the Hotel or it was the driver. But that Not belongs to faustin tours. The Problem we got was, that we wanted a new driver and since that he didn¢®?t answered any of our calls. Our Guide was sitting next to us and Wrote with faustin what means that he saw our calls and didn¢®?t picked them up on purpose.
We accepted that we don¢®?t get a new driver so we drove to udzungwa the next day. But when we came there he didn¢®?t payed the entry fee so we had to wait there Many Hours because we couldn¢®?t enter the park and Start hiking. We tried to reach Faustin but without any success so we had to pay it again and went to a lot of trouble with the personnel of the wild park. The only helpful person being the tour guide that will definitely not work for Faustin again! So far all attempts to reach anyone at faustin travel were without success. No one answers the phone or writes back on messages - very poor! 
Also we came there and suddenly he said we don¢®?t get any lunch, although it was included in our offer.
After we came back there was Money over that Had to be payed, but he also didn¢®?t send the guide the Money and didn¢®?t pick up the phone as usual.
So i recommend you to Never do a Tour With faustin Tours and safaris! 
He¢®?s absolutely unprofessionell and criminell.
If you want to do a safari or hiking trips i really recommdent taylor safaris, the Agency where our Guide Kevin was from. He was really nice and helped us a lot. "

We saw a lot of animals and had a great guide. But we would definitely not recommend to go whit World Air Travel & Tours in Arusha. On the first day or care broke down after 30 minutes. All day the guide tried to fix the car but it broke down five times. He managed to drive to the gate of the Serengeti but then the car was totally broken. 
All cars break down some day. The roads are poor so this things happen. no problem. But World Air Travel & Tours laid all the time about the solution. There say they had sent a another car and it will arrive soon. After all the other car arrived 14 hours after they told us he would.
So we missed the first day and half of or second day. On a safari of four days this is a lot so we asked about a compensation. we paid a lot of money fore the safari (6 persons 4days and $900,- per person). We missed more than  1/4 of the safari. They offer us an extra day in the Serengeti for $130 a person or get a refund of $ 30,- per person. Even after hard bargaining this was their final offer. 
Very pour solution and very bad compensation. If ever tithing is going to plan it is no problem to go whit World Air Travel & Tours . But if there is a problem after you paid, it¢®?s your problem.

Peter Johannes Klein,UK,Visited: September 2014,06-Oct-14,20-35,first safari,Trans Kibo Travels,2,Did not fullfill our expectations and what we have booked,"We were 2 persons and booked 3 days hiking Mt. Meru and 4 days safari for approx. USD 1500 each person.

Every day we had discussions with the guides or persons who conducted the tours. They wanted too high tips for average or under average services. We had acrid discussions about the tips.

In our mentally and physically worst moment on Mt. Meru on the summit day when we slept only 3 hours, climbed 1300 vertical meters up to 4500m and 1300 down, had still another 2000 vertical meters down towards us and BEFORE we got a meal, they asked us how about the tipping and if we already know their tipping guidelines and if we now could give the tips.

On safari, we booked 2 days Serengeti, 1 day Ngorongoro and 1 Tarangire National Park. The truth is, you only get half of these days because the rest of these days is travel time to the next destination or camping site. Our guide did not explain anything. Just nothing. He just drove the car and did no else ""guiding service"""
Phil,CZ,Visited: February 2019,24-Feb-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Lians Travel Africa,1,"abandoned with 6 Czech citizens, money stolen, police investigation, horrible safari","Booked a safari for 7 to Maasai Mara and Nakuru National park which was to start on 11th February to 14th February, Valentines day. We paid the full fee which was all inclusive, but the surprises began, we didn¢®?t get lunch on the first day, 11th February, I contacted the owner Lilian who said clients buy their own lunch. Firstly, it had been paid for and secondly she went on to lie that we are suposed to have lunch in Maasai Mara. we were told to leave Nairobi at 9 a.m. and thanks to delays, we left at 10 a.m.  and we were supposed to have lunch at 1 p.m. or even 2 p.m.?? I asked her if we were meant to have two lunches or what? She then said we would get packed lunch on our way to Nakuru?? So in fact we were getting lunch but on a different day? On the day we were going to Nakuru there was lunch at the hotel and have the packed lunch that we missed? The lies were so bad you just tell this woman was a bad liar. I asked that there be no problems from that point forward,no reply. One of the guests was ill but didn¢®?t even have free lunch,how pathetic from Lians Travel! We got a very nice welcome at Mara Sidai and the guest went on to rest and was to miss the next day¢®?s Safari.
12th February: we go on safari all day,packed lunch,everything was superb I must say. The sick guest was well rested and everything seemed fine with the world.
13th February: no game drive in the morning?? In the itinerary,depart from Mara for a 3 hour distance to Nakuru? That was problem number one, problem two,driver says he can¢®?t leave because he has issues with the owner. He asks me to contact her and I do. I was furious at that point, we were standing by the roadside,having driven some distance from Maasai Mara, the driver says that he doesn¢®?t have enough money to go to Nakuru. I called Lilian who claimed the driver was trying to sabotage her. I got confused because I and the others wondered if the driver was in fact the problem. Instead of enjoying our safari, we all became Sherlocks trying to find out who was lying to us, the driver,Lilian the owner of Lians Travel Africa? Who? After Lilian claims that the driver is trying to sabotage her, she tells me secretly to get off at Narok town. Now,are we ghosts to exit the vehicle at Narok without the driver noticing? What IQ does one need to realize that? I realized though where the problems were coming from. I tell the driver what I¢®?ve been told,he is still visibly nervous and uncertain and I wasnt sure if we would continue with the safari, interrupt our safari and go to the police station or not. I tried to call this woman called Lilian and when she realized that the driver was listening in the call, she starts to accuse me of being in cahoots with the driver and trying to sabotage her. I am her client and I paid for the safari and she was accusing me of sabotaging her and my own safari?? What person of sound mind would come to such a conclusion? She texted me the same thing and said that since I started it,I should sort myself out. I called her,her words,¢®¡¾ I don¢®?t care, you started it, sort yourselves out¢®¡¾ There were 6 foreigners in the car,some of whom cannot speak English and she was ready to ditch them in Narok, later on, that¢®?s what she did.
Poor them, I had to explain what was going on. We were stuck between her and the unpaid driver. The driver didn¢®?t want to leave Mara and he just couldn¢®?t leave us stranded with our luggage. Lilian left us at the driver¢®?s mercy, so we and the unpaid driver had to find a way to get out of this crazy mess. The person we paid the money to,Lilian, adamant and it was clear she wouldn¢®?t help. I told her to call the driver and that I was not her go between,I was her client but she even ridiculed me and said that since I became the spokesman of the trip,i her own client,had become the object of ridicule, simply incredible how rude, how selfish and heartless a person can be! She even claimed that since I was a Kikuyu,one Kenyan tribe, I was stealing from the other foreigners too, she assumed that since I was the only black person on the safari, I was either too poor to be there or I was stealing from the other foreigners in the van,little did she know that I was with my wife and in laws and friends and not some clients I had lied too. On top of the problems, she goes on to ridicule me because of the colour of my skin and my name, JUST BECAUSE I'M BLACK, DOES IT MEAN I CANNOT AFFORD TO BUY MYSELF A SAFARI??Anyway, we pleaded with the driver to go to Narok and figure it out because it was clear she wouldn¢®?t pay him and expected us to pay more money to finish our own trip. The driver hesitantly agreed to go since he was now operating at a loss. At this point,we may have been stuck in Maasai Mara, Narok, the side of the road, a ditch but Lilian from Lians Travel Africa had abandoned all parties and even suggested we go to the police. I told her these were my family members so I would certainly go to report her. She texted that she had left the park fees at the hotel reception and was done with us. I have the text message to prove this. We told the driver if the park fees are there, we can just fuel the car ourselves and go to Nakuru. It was either that or go to Nairobi and ruin the whole holiday without even having been to Nakuru.
We fueled in Narok, with our own money by the way, all the other travelers, all foreigners were now fully drawn into this situation, poor them, and what if they were alone left at the mercy of this heartless woman called Lilian, what would have happened then?She would have left them in Narok or in Maasai Mara with no way out of it.
We went to Nakuru and as far as we were concerned, Lians Travel Africa had no idea where we were. We went to Chester Hotel and I must say that at Chester we had such a warm welcome but they noticed something was off. We had lunch and we were curious if the park fees had indeed been sent or not and when the receptionist was calling and calling Lilian awaiting for confirmation, we just told her, ¢®¡ÆWe are dealing with a conwoman here, she will not send the money,kindly avoid speaking with her¢®¡¾. Since we are here, and despite not having the park fees paid, we decided to pay it ourselves. The driver wanted to leave and go to Nairobi so actually we almost didn¢®?t go because he was still operating at a loss, we had only fueled him until Nakuru so if he wanted to leave he could have. I can say it¢®?s really not the kind of mood you want on your holiday or safari. Some didn¢®?t go to Lake Nakuru National Park, they were already pissed off by everything, a big thanks to Lians Travel for that by the way. We went to the park, paid our own park fees, and I have the receipts to prove it. We had like one hour only in the park, from what was supposed to be like 4 hours or more, but the driver was fantastic and he was still a proper guide in spite of what was going on. Lilian has the audacity to ¢®¡Æenquire whether we had checked in and decided to pay our own park fees¢®¡¾ and I told her to fuck off, because seriously, after ditching us in Narok, she was waiting by her phone and calling the reception to find out if we had made it to Nakuru, how horrible, how despicable! I can¢®?t fathom of the kind of person who would do such a thing. She even ends her messages with ""Have a blessed day"". i mean who does that? How terrible and cruel must you be to make fun, insult someone at the comfort of one's office without a care in the world, all while screeching at us on the phone. We went back, had dinner and reflected on the past events of the day unaware of whether our driver would return or not.
14th February: Valentines day in the worst circumstances, we wake up to the question of whether our driver is still there and luckily he was. We all just wanted to go back to Nairobi, and since Lilian had urged us to go to the police, we went to The Tourist police and spent hours telling and retelling the story and by no means did I wanna spend my time at a police station on my holiday. After a long time the OCS came and it was already apparent who the cause of the problems was, he called her up and just like she did to us, she kept on yelling and yelling, with a police officer, no respect even for the law, so as I write this, I urge, I beseech and ask that you not do business with Lians Travel Africa. That wasn¢®?t the end, the OCS asked her to come to the police station but of course she was busy, she asked him to go to the police station, the next day and so the story continues.

15th February: 10 a.m. Did the lady show up? She didn¢®?t. As I write this, we still have no word from her, she didn¢®?t intend to show up at the police station, and she is playing a waiting game until we leave. Our experience with Lians Travel Africa has been nothing but disappointing, I guess no refunds are coming but the word had to come out, I write this on your behalf, the traveler that may lay eyes on Lians Travel Africa and think of doing a trip with them, I again urge, beseech and ask you to avoid this company called Lians Travel Africa headed by one Lilian Maina, she put me and my guests, all foreigners through hell after paying full fees. No refunds as of now, no word from the woman and she has refused to show to the authorities, what would she do to you and your fellow travelers, you have seen my experience, do avoid this company. You will be left on the roadside, abandoned in a foreign country if you are a foreign traveler, money stolen, trip ruined, use Lians Travel Africa at your own risk. The police investigation is still going on, as to whether it's a real company or not, she has not presented herself to the authorities and has stolen our money with no intention of returning it, she shall do the same to you, the future traveller who reads this, I am writing this review on your behalf, to save you from the agony of a ruined holiday, STAY AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY!"
Phil Ayres,KE,Visited: January 2016,25-Aug-16,35-50,2-5 safaris,Drifters,1,Namibia overland tour was exhausting and an operational disaster,"We were hoping for a great group tour to Namibia, after traveling independently through South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana. Unfortunately we were sadly disappointed. In addition to completely avoidable issues, which hopefully would never happen to you (your guide can't reenter the country because he didn't have a with permit for the full trip!), the Namibia tour itself was exhausting with very little opportunity to appreciate the country. Overall, Drifters operations, communication and guiding was well below any standard I would expect.

If all Drifters tours are like this, think carefully if you want to enjoy the countries you visit with them. You'd be better off putting in the effort yourself to self-drive.

If you want more details, we blogged about our experience here: https://www.wigglypath.com/no-more-overland-tours/

I can't imagine ever taking another tour with Drifters. I would advise anybody considering it to try and find positive reviews for then before booking."

Michael Ndallo from Northern Circuit Adventure could offer us the perfect safari trip according to our plans, 5 days and 4 nights camping. However, on departure day when on our way to begin the safari, Michael Ndallo informs us that he has changed the agreed itinerary without noticing us - to fit more people into the group. By doing this he left us no choice but to go on a safari which was not what we had planed.

Our driver and guide, Masha, did an excellent job through the entire trip, he is a bomb of information regarding wildlife and nature in Tanzania.

Phuong,VN,Visited: January 2020,07-Feb-20,35-50,first safari,Shemeji Safari Tanzania,1,Poor facility and poor resoponsibilities,"We had an unforgettable trip in many ways:
- staff with us are friendly
- but the first day to pick us up from hotel the car had issue so the driver was late 30 minutes
- the company did not consult not give us any advices about the tour they are selling with the weather condition before we decided. When our last day trip was cancelled because the rain washed out the bridge then they played ¢®¡Æinnocent¢®¡¾ and blamed the weather. As a tour agency but they don¢®?t know about the weather of the season and what may cause then they are not professional and don¢®?t know well about their work. We did not received any warning from them
- the chef is nice, cooking well but that is when he cooks. 50% of our lunch box and 50% of our breakfast were sandwiches which I could not eat, I chose to eat other things and sandwiches were the leftover. I know this is not about the chef but that is what the company is able to provide. And normally we don¢®?t eat this kind of food at home bit we know that is what they could offer so we did not complain anything. But I still want to raise my voice on review about this so others could  consider.
- office response slowly to give advices to give help when we had troubles on the road. When my driver found down the road was off by rain and he said our trip plan was changed and trying to contact office for advices from morning but until 2 pm we received their phone call to give solution. Same with car broke-down accident, office gave slow response.
- The campsite so call ¢®¡Æmain office¢®¡¾ of Shemeji, the road is really muddy and our car was stuck 2 hours there. The tour agency can¢®?t predict or can¢®?t affect the road in safari but at least they can fix the road at their own place. They should not let the car stuck in mug 2 hours and wasted clients¢®? time at least at their own campsite. For this, I see they don¢®?t really give their best for the service
- Even though in the ¢®¡ÆTerm and Condition¢®¡¾ they wrote: car breakdown is not acceptable but it happened to us and they just blamed for weather and road. It made our trip shorter, more tired, mentally effected by the scare about this risk of life but they tried not to mention about this accident. After all the payment was done we don¢®?t see much any support from management. All they do is trying to protect their own benefit to not refund us the payment we spent for the service we did not receive.
The Safari itself is worth visiting, but Shemeji is not worth chosen for your trip. I don not recommend."

The car showed up on time in Nairobi and the ride to Amboseli was fine. We had to pay the driver 4000 Ksh to stay in the area for four days and then take us to the bus. 
The day the driver was to appear he never did. A call to Ken and another car showed up about two hours later. These guys were locals in Amboseli and drive us to Emhali where we were supposed to get on the ""First Class Bus"". Of course when we got there they immediately started in on us about how Ken had ripped us off, was not paying them and the bus would not stop in Emhali. We awaited about two hours for the bus all the while listening to them tell us over and over how there was no bus. It was getting late and rather than have to spend the night in a very small and very scary town we agreed to let them drive us to Mtito which was about 90 minutes away at a cost of 9000Ksh. There was a local bus in Mtitto that took us to Mombasa at a cost of 1000 Ksh even though we had already paid Ken 7000 Ksh for a ""First Class bus"". We had no choice so went. We later found out the same bus stopped in Emhali earlier while we were arguing with the drivers
When we got back to Nairobi we visited Ken at the office and demanded a refund. We went back and forth and he agreed to a partial refund. If you have been keeping up we spent 4000 Ksh to keep the driver around, 7000 Ksh for the bus tickets we didn't use, 9000 Ksh to go to a different town and 2000 for the bus tickets we did use a total of 22,000 Ksh. We got a refund of 7000 Ksh.

Instead the offered us a coffee tour, which was very boring. Then they were going to send us to the wrong national park. When we told them that we booked for another park they send us with very last minute with a different guide. We had to join our original guide later that day, but our guide refused to bring us there initially. When we insisted he became very angry and unpleasant. We tried to bargain for a discount for the inconvenience and after a long discussion we were promised a discount of 400USD. But then later that day they denied this promise and threatened to skip our last day if we didn't pay up.

Blue Montain Trekking & Safaris

On 22 May 2018 we visited your office and my wife and me were looking for a tree days Safari. We talked  to one of you employee Mr. Ben (Tel. 0721362462) and he gave us information. He suggested to stay in the camp at Rhino camp in a tent. The price will be around 760 US $. We did not talk so much about the price because we knew your official price was about 340.00 US $ for tree days Safari. At that time we did not make our final decision. 
On the next day, we decided to go to Safari and came back to the office opposite of Hilton. My wife was a little bit scared from the staying in a tent. Then we asked for a lodge. Mr. Ben maked a suggestion. He said that we can stary in a lodge at Ol Moran Camp. He suggested a price of 1160.00 US $. Finally we agreed to pay 930.00 US $. We paid 100.00 US $ in advance. We have been told that we should pay the rest on 25th May where the trip started. On 25th May, in the morning I have paid the rest, 830.00 US $ in cash and asked for a receipt. He denied to give me a receipt. He has just written on the first receipt (which we have received on 22th May) that the balance has been paid. See the attached receipt. I knew that was not correct. On the way we picked up to german ladies. On the car someone has prepared a regular receipt and gave to these ladies. They paid 30.000 Schlings per Person (300.00 US $). 
 

We arrived  at the Ol Morano camp, the driver, Patrick, has dropped us and left immediately. Then we were asking for a lodge. We have told that there was no lodge only tents. I called Ben back and the driver. We could not change anyting. We paid a price of a lodge, however we stayed in a tent. 
Finally, instead of 600.00 US $ we paid 930.00 US $. We have been swindled by Mr. Ben. He is one of the biggest liar that I have seen in my life. A guy like that would damage your company. 
I am sure that this guy has prepared an official receipt which is probably around 600.00 US $. The rest is in his pocket. 
One more story, according to the program, on the third day we should first go to the park for three hours and then back to Nairobi. The driver discoverd a new story and talked about the boat trip on a river somewhere else. Some people agreed but we did not. I didn¢®?t want to wait for other people during boat trip. I told Patrick that we want to go to Nairobi. Underway he had difficulties to arrange a car for us. Finally at the place where we had lunch he has arranged a Safari car.  The driver of this car dropped us at a benzin station in Nairoby.  Finally with a arranged taxi we arrived at our hotel. Why should we take three different cars to come to our hotel?
Now I am asking you why the driver Patrick discovered a boat trip which was not on program. Does he has some benefits from boat trip? Why did he not drive for three hours to National Park as we have been told? 
I would like to leave Kenya with a good impression. However, people like Ben would harm the people.   
I kindly ask you to search this process and inform me and compensate the money which I have paid more.

Rachel Cardoso Rubim,BR,Visited: July 2018,12-Sep-18,65+,first safari,Tanzania,1,Disappointing,"Our car had an electric problem with the charger on the second day but the guide could drive it.  On the third day of safari the guide left us at an information station at 10 am telling us that he would fix the car and disappeard for more than 4 hours,  wasting our time and Safari. We were alone, not knowing what was happening and very scared. After asking for him to several other guides who were on site, we were able to locate our guide. 
Then came the worst !!! We went in our car without repairing to the Lodge and soon to travel to the North Serengeti.
The guide drove like crazy, we saw several animals on the way, including a rhinoceros a few feet from our car, but he did not stop and said we would see lots of animals in Northern Serengeti in the following days !!! And got lost because he did not know the place !!! For five hours we were driving in circles and the guide didn't want to admit that he was lost.  We arrived at the Lodge around 10:00 p.m. because we begged him to ask for information from a car from a local company that passed by our car, luckily ours. We have to remember that it is totally forbidden to do excursions or safari at night and we were very lucky to have seen the headlights of this car! 
The next day,  he didn't tell us that the car was broken and that we could not do the Safari. We communicated with the owner of Quest Horizon, who only then organized a new car and another guide. We missed the whole morning to go to Safari! The new guide only stayed with us that day and the other day another car was organized and a new guide arrived almost 2 hours late !! We lost almost 3 days of Safari and had lots of wear and stress.
The owner got us a flight to try to make up for so much lost time and we went to Lake Manyara which has practically no animal. It was the minimum that he could do!
We were very sad to lose so many days in such wonderful places in Central and North Serengeti."

Raja,UK,Visited: May 2023,17-Oct-23,50-65,first safari,Adventure Expeditions,1,Terrible experience & customer service,"I recently embarked on what was supposed to be an unforgettable adventure with Expeditions Adventures and Safaris, but unfortunately, it turned out to be a complete disaster. From start to finish, my experience with this company was riddled with numerous issues and disappointments that left me frustrated and regretful.

First and foremost, the communication with Expeditions Adventures and Safaris was abysmal. Prior to the trip, I had several inquiries and concerns that I needed clarification on, but their customer service was unresponsive and lacked any sense of urgency. It took weeks and multiple attempts for them to finally address my questions, leaving me feeling neglected and uncertain about the trip.

Upon arriving at my destination, the problems only escalated. The accommodations that were promised during the booking process were far from what was delivered. The room was dirty, with stained bedding and a strong odor that made it unbearable to spend any time in. The bathroom was in a deplorable state, with broken fixtures and a lack of essential toiletries. It was evident that the property had not been properly maintained, and it was a far cry from the advertised luxurious experience.

The tour guides provided by Expeditions Adventures and Safaris were equally disappointing. They seemed disinterested and lacked knowledge about the destinations we visited. Their lack of professionalism was evident in their disorganized approach and inability to provide insightful information. I had hoped to learn and experience the local culture, but instead, I was met with apathy and a mere surface-level tour.

To add insult to injury, the transportation arrangements were a complete nightmare. The vehicles provided were outdated, uncomfortable, and in dire need of maintenance. On multiple occasions, the vehicles broke down, leaving us stranded in remote locations for hours. This not only wasted precious time but also put our safety at risk. The negligence shown by the company in maintaining their vehicles was truly alarming.

Lastly, a lack of empathy and accountability was evident in the owner response. Rather than taking responsibility for the shortcomings of his company, he seemed more interested in deflecting blame or downplaying the severity of the problems we encountered. This lack of ownership and willingness to rectify the situation demonstrated a profound disregard for customer well-being. I have to say the he seemed drunk.

In conclusion, my experience with Expeditions Adventures and Safaris was nothing short of a nightmare. The lack of communication, subpar accommodations, unprofessional guides, unreliable transportation, and poorly executed itinerary all contributed to a deeply disappointing and frustrating journey. I would strongly advise against booking any trips with this company, as they failed to deliver on their promises and left me with a lasting negative impression."

We had ordered 11 days round-trip to Uganda. We met with the owner Richard who brought an itinerary and a contract stating that everything we payed for in the trip was based on the itinerary. However, during the trip, half of the nights the accommodation was changed last minute. The worst thing was that the accommodation change was often for the worse, and some nights we stayed in so filthy and bad accommodation we rather wanted to leave and pay for accommodation elsewhere by ourselves. In the trip we had also booked Chimpanzee trekking in Kibale as the big highlight. We arrived in a town near Kibale at around 3 pm the day before the trekking, where the tour operator (Richard) calls us to let us know that we are not able to make the Kibale chimpanzee trekking because he failed to get the permits, THE DAY BEFORE WE HAD TO GO. Additionally, the itinerary stated that lunch and drinking water would be included all days which we rarely got. 
Besides these problems, there were a lot of other issues about Richard miscommunication with the driver/guide and confusing us and our guide several times. Richard does not care about his customers, he just wants their money and will thereafter ensure that you have a completely disorganized trip. We managed to get the money back from the chimpanzee trekking permits, but honestly, with all the change in accommodation and all the last minute changes he put us through, he should have compensated us a lot more money for a failed trip in many regards. 
If I could, I would NEVER book this tour again and would AT ANY TIME pick another tour operator. Its one of the most stressful trips and dysfunctional tours I have ever been on even though we payed to have all inclusive in order to relax and not mind anything. Even though I go on vacation 4 times a year and have been pretty much everywhere in the world, I have never tried anything like this.
Luckily, the driver and guide Paddy was an extremely polite and nice young man. We had a very nice time with him, and we felt bad for him that he had to endure the constant miscommunication and our anger about the trip due to Richards incompetence.
LASTLY, there we some parts of the itinerary which was completely wrong and falsely stated. One of the days it was stated that you get to the park, go inside (which cost 40 dollars per day per person) and go for safari. This was not the case, and Richard would not pay to let us stay inside the park and go for safari even though he acknowledged that it was wrongly stated on the itinerary, so we ended up paying ourselves.
Lastly but not least, it got so bad at one time we went to the police in order to charge Richard and make him pay some of our money back for the failed experiences. We found out it was a very long process and did not want to spend vacation time on it, but I would wish now that we would have filed a complaint and charged him so he would hopefully learn that you cannot take tourists money and then piss on them afterwards. 
I HOPE THAT NO ONE PICKS THIS COMPANY IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GOOD NICE TIME AND RELAXING SAFARI.
Otherwise, Uganda is a lovely country and the nature and the parks a breathtaking."
Ray,KR,Visited: July 2023,31-Jul-23,20-35,first safari,Exciting Africa Holidays,1,Not trustworthy,"Treats foreign customers like an ATM. The attitude towards you dramatically changes before and after the payment.

1. Last minute itinerary change
Other tour operators notified me that due to the recent change in the park entrance policy, they only offer two-day safari tour. But Exciting Africa Holidays said their tour is three-day. To confirm this, I sent them an email and received a positive response, which influenced my choice for this tour. But, on the day of the tour, i was told that there will only be a two-day program due to the 'recent' change in park policy. That just spoiled my day. 

2. Lying about drinking water
At the Nairobi tour office, I was verbally assured that the package included '1 litre of bottled water per person per day'. But upon my arrival in Masai Mara, I was told that there is no water to give us... I mean, why lie about water? If it's not included, just tell me, and I'll grab some in town! (fwiw, they did provide water at day2 after my complaint, but the emotional stress i had to go through on day1 was immense)

3. Lack of communication
They dropped us off at some random place, not the one we were supposed to stay at. We were totally lost. After I paid, communication between me, the tour operator, and our driver went from great to non-existent. If they had to switch the accommodation, that's fine, but give us a heads up! And there's even a signal in Masai Mara if you're with Safaricom.

When I brought up these issues with the tour operator after the tour, he raised his voice, telling me to send a formal written complaint. So here's my formal complaint.
 This safari tour was supposed to be a once-in-a-lifetime adventure, but picking this operator was a major mistake.

For the record, I was more than satisfied with our driver Shadi, he was very kind and professional. I had issues only with the tour operator, Exciting Africa Holidays. (It seems like multiple tour operators pool the tourists and assign them to different vehicles)"

We still didn't receive any refund from Africa Flash Mc Tours.

Beware when booking with this company. Peter who runs this company is a very dishonest man and his company is NOT registered with the ministry of tourism in Kenya.

I booked a trekking/safari tour with Africa Flash Mctours and made the full payment a month in advance. After flying 12hours to start my safari tour, peter and his tour guide was no where to be found. He claimed to be sorting out money issues at the bank but after waiting several hours for him at the hotel, peter never showed up.

This issue was brought to the ministry of tourism and found out that his company is not a legally registered tour company. DO NOT put your trust in booking with this company.

Peter offered to make a full refund to us as we never got to even start our safari tour. Til this day, Peter still has NOT refunded all our money. It has been almost 4 months."

Our contact person was Steve Boko. When we reached Nirobi there is no Steve anymore it was Naftale from Neo Destinations. Our biggest mistake was we paid the money before. This company do not have their own vehicles and they sub contract with others who has no relation with us. The driver/guide was Robinson who is a jackass. In the entire 11 days he used to scold kids and always says he will throw out of his van. The trouble started when we reached Tanzania, we were taken to a tented camp at night instead of a lodge which was booked for us before and next day we are told that they will drop us at
Tanzania border and need to talk to our operator(Naftale) who was absconding. We were forced to go to police station for help to keep the driver in check at Lake Navisha. Over all a terrible experience with this guy. Kenya is a beautiful country but cheats like Naftale/Robinson(Neo Destinations/ African safaris) spoiling the country name.

We had a group of 8 people and booked a 10-day package service with the company. The two drivers (also the guides) assigned to us were totally unprofessional, especially one of the drivers who name is Carlos. Carlos had been playing a game during the safari with us all the time. During one of the safari days, he left and dropped us in the middle of the game drive and requested us to join the other group to continue the drive, as he needed to go to pick up the park tickets and had his car have maintenance service. Also, on one of the days, he just disappeared and remained unreachable for the entire day. As a result, we lost one day to experience the game drive and were left in the hotel for doing nothing. The company Starluck however did NOTHING and was unable to resolve the issue after receiving our complaints, which was totally a disappointment.

That being said, this is ABSOLUTLY not a company to recommend."

remo maria,IT,Visited: July 2023,06-Sep-23,50-65,over 5 safaris,Kiliholidays Tours & Safaris,1,terrible experience,"These are the serious problems, defaults, and contractual misrepresentations I had to endure that ruined my vacation.

1) I had booked the trip in 2020 before the covid. I paid an advance of $1000 in February 2020. As you know, due to covid the borders were closed, making it impossible to make the trip. Mr. Mack of Killiholidays told me that I could reschedule it later. HE NEVER Mentioned any costs to reschedule the trip, EVEN IN HIS MAIL OF 2022 IN WHICH HE HAS GIVEN ME THE POSSIBILITY TO SCHEDULE IT FOR 2023.
When I rescheduled the trip for this year, when there were finally no more problems tied to COVID, Mr. Mack told me that he was only recognizing $500 of the $1000 ALREADY PAID. Never before had Mr. Mack told me that I would lose that money if I rescheduled the trip. 
I repeatedly asked for explanations but the information I received was very vague. Just not to lose another $500, I still decided to book the trip with him, but subject to recourse. 
By reason of the fact that Mr. Mack has never documented to me any expenses incurred by him for changes in travel dates and has since proved himself to be non-compliant in various other respects, which I will explain below, and which suggest how he decided to withhold $500 for no reason whatsoever) I consider it incumbent upon him to return this $500 to me. On closer inspection, in fact, $500 (i.e., 50 percent of the advance) is a penalty for cancelling a trip and certainly cannot be withheld where the trip is actually made instead.
It should also be considered that the cost of the trip compared to the original cost has increased a great deal from what was agreed upon in 2020. In 2020 we had agreed on a total of 3800 euros, while the request for 2023 was a whopping 4600 euros!

2) Mr. Mack sold me the lodge in Nierere Park as a lodge with a swimming pool. It is the Mloki Lodge, as shown in the brochure. In fact, the lodge does not have a swimming pool and never has. To prove my point I attach the brochure of the trip where there are photos of the nonexistent pool and the link of the mloka lodge https://www.mlokasafarilodge.com/ where it can be verified that there was never any pool.
Moreover, I immediately wrote to Mr. Mack astonished at the incident, but he did not reply, shutting himself in an embarrassed silence. This too is a serious breach of duty by Mr. Mack and shows his bad faith and his attempt to deceive me. I should add that almost all the photos in the brochure sent by Mr. Mack do not correspond to the Mloki lodge booked, which is much less luxurious.

3) The program Mr. Mack sent me states that the transfer from Nierere to Mikumi was 4-5 hours. This is a route that took as many as 8, and this is the time normally needed, as can be seen from Google Map. Knowing this, I would never have agreed to do such a demanding program, or to do it under the conditions indicated to me by Mr. Mack.

4) Mr. Mack charged me, due to his mistake, for an extra night at the Ruaha River Lodge. Realizing the mistake, acknowledged by Mr. Mack himself. I then repeatedly asked for a refund (this was the not insignificant amount of $650) but the cash money never arrived, despite Mr. Mack's continuous reassurances that I would receive a refund as early as August 15. Upon not receiving the refund, I immediately assumed that I would never see that money again. This was also due to the fact that I had asked Mr. Mack to transfer it to me via Paypal, while he said he did not have Paypal, while in the emails Mr. Mack claims to have a Paypal accounT.

5) also in the brochure sent to me, it mentions a transfer from Ruaha to Dar es Salaam on August 28 with a leisurely departure at 10 a.m. (note that the next day we had a plane at 5 a.m. to return to Turkey, where we then continued to Italy), for 6 hours maximum travel time. I later found out from the driver (a very serious person) that the trip from Ruaha to Dar is an 11-12 hour drive, which is also confirmed by Google Maps, which estimates the trip at 10.47 hours (without the stops needed to get gas, go to the toilet, etc.). 12 hours of travel time by car was never on my radar, and I also find it risky to subject the driver to such grueling hours. If I had known, of course, I would never have agreed to such a schedule, which, as can be seen, is clearly false in some places and neglects crucial information;

6) The 12 hours of never-announced travel could easily have been avoided, since Mr. Mack could have had me leave for the safari a day earlier, and break the return from Ruaha into two days: in fact, I had expressed all willingness to anticipate our arrival. Not only that. He himself had said that he would study this possibility.
Finding myself in this situation, I asked Mr. Mack to book me a plane from Ruaha to Dar es Salaam, asking him at least to use the $500 advance unduly withheld. He refused, of course, and demanded instead to use the $650 he owed me. To that $650 I then had to add another $135 because the plane ticket cost much more. 
I agreed to pay this amount for the following reasons:
1) because I was sure that the $650, otherwise, I would never see it again for the reasons already explained, 
2) because without the plane flight, the last day of the vacation would have been a massacre (imagine a 12-hour drive and then having to catch the plane at 5 a.m. the next day)
3) I would also have run the risk of missing the return flight from Dar to Istanbul, should there be any problems.

However, this is a cost that I could easily have avoided if Mr. Mack, without overlooking the very relevant circumstance that the trip from Ruaha to Dar took 11-12 hours (and not 6), had anticipated the safari by one day, as I had repeatedly requested.

Again, then, Mr. Mack attempted to con me into more money. Think about the fact that after the same man forced me to pay the $135 for the airfare, he called me and told me that the flight from Ruaha to Dar was no longer available, and that I would have to leave from Iringa. This is a much cheaper and much less comfortable flight. Clearly, Mr. Mack wanted me to take that flight so he could keep the $135 already paid, and also profit from the difference between the lower cost of the flight to Iringa and the $650 used to buy the flight from Ruaha. I objected strongly, and after I threatened him, suddenly the flight from Ruaha came up.

I have submitted all these facts to the Arusha Police."

The accommodation where we stayed the first two nights, cottage in Mikumi, was very poor (shower didn't work, room wasn't really clean, some windows did not have curtains, AC only worked 10% of the time) but the view was amazing. The food they served was average, if there was any. After our morning drive we only got an egg for breakfast... So our driver took us somewhere else for lunch, which was great, the food was really good and we had a fantastic view over the wildlife park.
The accommodation in which we were supposed to stay in Udzungwa appeared to be fully booked (how is that possible when you book your tour two months in advance??), but luckily they were able to place us in Hondo Hondo instead of a downgrade hotel they offered us at first.

Our car broke down on the way to the Mara Masai and the driver was completely inept. We ended up waiting three hours for a new car and driver to take us to our lodge. We arrived at night and missed our game drive. 

Because we were only now doing game drives on Saturday and Sunday. We only needed one pass, despite the two we were charged. When confronting the driver about this. He said that wasn't true because we would enter the park 7am Saturday and leave 8:30-9am Sunday which is an half or two longer than the 24 hour permit. On Sunday he drove us until 8am when he left early. suspicious I grabbed our park receipts when the driver stopped to get breakfast. (He told us it was a bathroom break then disappeared for twenty minutes many instances of terrible communication). sure enough he only bought one day passes and was pocketing the $500 in fees our group paid. 

When confronting the company about it they said they'd talk to the driver. They refuse to reimburse the park fee I paid for but was never purchased. Overall the quality was well below par, go to a different budget safari. The positive reviews here are because Masai Mara will always be a positive experience.

2. The only comment he made was""elephant"" or ""buffalo"", hardly spoke any English

3. Guide forgot guidebook and binoculars. Tomorrow, tomorrow he said.The next day he got us broken binoculars and a dirty old guidebook.

4. We called Antelope safaris several times. They did not call back for the following reasonit is expensive to call a foreign number- as if we did not roam and as if Skype does not exist!

6. They came over to our place in Dar in order to apologize- see above to read how it went. They later explained that the"" man did not like the fact that we complained""

7. They did not give any compensation- that strengthened our feeling that they really did not care about us, but just about earning easy money.

Robert (UK),AE,Visited: August 2019,10-Sep-19,35-50,first safari,Rhino Explorer Tours & Safaris,1,Do not use this company! Terrible professionalism.,"My wife and I did the 7 night wildebeest migration safari in mid-August 2019. 
We were picked up at the airport and driven to Arusha to meet Daniel and asked to handover the full trip cost in cash ? several thousand USD. Do not do this as if we hadn¢®?t we would have cancelled and used another company due to issues which occurred later. I suggest you ¢®?pay as you go¢®?, only pay by credit card and get a receipt. Others did this on our tour. Once we paid the money Daniel failed to answer any of our calls during the trip when we tried to inform him of the guide¢®?s behaviour or seek his assistance. It was really unprofessional.
The first night, the guide, Malaki came to our hotel and told us he would pick us up the next day at 8am for our drive into the Serengeti. We were ready at 7.45am at reception having checked out of the hotel but Malaki did not arrive until 10.45am without bothering to answer our calls or inform us of the delay. Upon arrival Malaki informed us that he was late because the others on the tour wanted to sleep in. This caused an argument between us and the other tour members which was a disaster for starting our week long safari experience together. We later found out after bonding with the group that Malaki was in fact lying and the delay was due to the tour company not having all the equipment for the campers. This really was an awful start to the camaraderie of the group and almost ruined the holiday. One customer even left the group after this day due to having experienced the late departure twice in two days and the lies. 
The second night after a long drive to the Serengeti we arrived at what Malaki said was our hotel at 7pm only for us to be told at reception that it was full. Our hotel was in fact an hour¢®?s drive away through the pitch black wilderness and Malaki with reckless driving hit a buffalo on the way and failed to stop or show any concern. The other tour members were camping near the first hotel so it meant we lost 2 hours of safari in the morning going to collect them. I would advise that either all members of the tour either stay in a hotel or camp. As we stayed in hotels but frequently had to wait for lengthy periods of time to pack up and set up the camping equipment for others in the morning and evening which made us miss a lot of the best time for safari experiences. The organisation was very poor especially when the hotel package is very expensive.
The serengti heritage camp and kilimanjoa accommodation were really good with super staff but the rest were quite poor. The sernegeti heritage camp boss ensured we had a hot breakfast at 5.30am when all the others just gave us packed boxes. We never really got to enjoy the hotels during daylight as most of the time we were waiting for the campers to set up or pack up which again was really poor organisation. We repeatedly requested that he could drop us at the hotels whilst all the camp site activity was being done but Malaki just repeatedly ignored us and did whatever he felt like. This after spending double what the customers staying at the camp site paid.
Wildlife was great. We saw the big 5 plus wildebeest migration and a lot more. However, after a while Malaki would not wait very long for us to take in the sites or see animals that we wanted to as he had a mind of his own and was always on the phone. 
On the way out of the Sernegti Malaki took us to a Masai camp of one of his friends and they tried to charge us $20 each just to visit the village. We all said no and Malaki spent the rest of the tour sulking, being grumpy and not listening to anything we requested. 
At the end one of the tour one member chose to give a tip to the chef but not Malaki due to his behaviour and Malaki, due to his arrogance, started shouting at him. It was really shocking. 
I really wouldn¢®?t recommend this company. I would recommend you hire a private bus with a group of 4-6 friends/family and there were many tour companies which looked much more professional than this one.

Beware of her and guide Robin coming back into the business under a different company name.

Before the Tour:  My repeated emails were typically returned days late.  I had to ask for receipts after monies were paid.  A ¢®¡Æmust have¢®¡¾ list never came.  I emailed the lodges on the tour itinerary a week before it started.  Only one lodge said they had a reservation under my name or Bella¢®?s.  I emailed Bella, and guide Robin responded that""all reservations are confirmed"" (liar).

The.. Tour:  Substitutions were made for all of the lodges listed on the itinerary.  I was picked up late every morning at my lodge, once 3 hours late.  Guide Robin said that the van had repairs done that day, but the driver told me in the afternoon that Robin spent the morning trying to get money.  They asked me for money on the second day ¢®? difficulties in Bella getting money to Robin (lie).   We spent an entire morning trying to get into Murchison NP - Robin with Bella on the phone tried to talk the person at the gate into letting us in.  Finally I paid (and was never reimbursed).  A joke.  The van was given gasoline 6 gallons at a time ? never filled.  Bottled water was purchased one bottle at a time.   The tour blew apart on day 5 in Kibale NP.  Bella never paid for my Chimp Habitation permit (surprise!) ? she asked me to pay the 200 USD fee.  Nope.  The game warden said I could go on the habitation if Bella got the money to him before I returned at the end of the day.  I went on the habitation but no money came.  When Guide Robin arrived to pick me up (I was the last person to be picked up out of 25 people) they kept him, fortunately letting me go back to the lodge with the driver.  The warden kept Robin in jail for the night because of lack of payment.  He was let out the next day.  I heard later that they were thinking of keeping me in jail, too!  The driver got disgusted with everything and drove his van home ? he had never been paid anything by Bella and had been using some of his own money to buy gas.  I stayed on one more day ? the wonderful lodge manager got me a ride back to Entebbe (200 USD) and I stayed in Entebbe until my plane left 5 days later.  Believe it or not Bella came out to Kibale NP and apologized ? too little too late.  She said I would be completely reimbursed for the tour (I¢®?m still waiting on the money that won¢®?t come !).  Bella and Robin wanted me to continue the tour!   I was genuinely concerned about my safety as well as being outraged with the tour.  When I got back to Entebbe the lodge people and other guides told me about Bella and her money problems.  They were angry with her for giving Uganda tourism a bad name.  I could tell more.  DO NOT GO NEAR!

The bottom line is that Bella let me fly 19 hours in the air to Uganda (and back home), pay 1500 USD roundtrip air, and pay her about 5000 USD in full for a trip that she knew that she could not pull off.  As low as you can get.  Would have liked to give zero stars.  Amazingly, she still has her website online and on Safari Bookings.

Roger,NO,Visited: June 2018,24-Jul-18,65+,over 5 safaris,Drive Tanzania Ltd,1,Professional fraudster & scam artist. Don't engage Drive Tanzania/Yoeni Japheth Mkiramweni.,"We hired a Toyota Land Cruiser from the sham company Drive Tanzania Ltd for 15 days (June-July 2018), paid in advance. The company address in Arusha is a parking lot! - the office is a cell phone. Despite calling it's self one of the ""biggest & best"" -we found out as we our trip progressed that everything is just fraud and lies. Yoeni doesn't own a single commercial safari vehicle. The 4x4 supplied was a private vehicle in unroadworthy condition, not commercial, and as such illegal without valid insurance. The brakes and steering were faulty, also no brake fluid & the engine devoid of oil, we had to fill both, not serviced for ages. 
In the Ngorongoro Crater the steering main joint broke as we parked. We were lucky it went then as at speed we would have either gone off the road, or the vehicle turned over. We were lucky we weren't killed. We were rescued by the Crater rangers who drove us out of the crater to our lodge. Three weeks later I'm told the vehicle is still in the crater, pending repairs to both steering and radiator before it can be driven out, also daily fines. We had to hire an alternative vehicle for the last 5 days, Yoeni true to form was impossible to contact. 
No lodgings had been ordered in advance for the driver, Yoeni told him that we hadn't paid him yet for the safari and therefore we would be paying for all his overnighting and food, also all the vehicles safari fees and expenses which according to the contract Drive Tanzania were responsible for. The driver was shocked when we showed him the contract - a clear breach of contract.
Eventually brought in by the police, in the presence of witnesses at the Arusha Tourist police station Yoeni promised to refund all the money he owed us by a stated date, through ""Malaika Tours"", also to pay his driver. More lies, the date has come and gone, he still hasn't refunded us anything and the poor driver also hasn't been paid. 
Yoeni is now the subject of a police investigation for this case and complaints from other customers, also investigation on suspecion of mis-appropriating WMA fees and Tanzanian VAT. He also offered to pay in the park fees for us in advance, his quote for 14 days was $4.000 which he didn't seem to be able to document. Needless to say the amount we ended up paying by Visa Card at the park gates was just $1.570 !! 

An incredible story - yes, and 100% true.

1. Driver didnt paid for the lunch om the way to Masai mara from Nairobi.
2. Driver didnt paid for the park entrt fees and was caught by ranger and we wasted our first day of safari
3. We were transferred to a different tent with no attached shower at midnight and also they were fighting with us when we said we will not go to a different tent. It was not safe to be at there at that time
4. I ordered cake for my wife but they forgot to make it and are yet to refund me the money
5. We are vegetarian an we confirmed that since beginning and yet we were given Nin-veg food.
6. Our Vehicle did not had radio , so following the rest was out of question.


Overall it was a terrible experience wherein nobody was there to take our call and listen our problem. The agency did not bother to take our call. 
There was another girl from Mexico who joined us on third day and she experienced the same."

Did the one night safari trip and it was ridiculous. Arrived way too late at the park so we had only 2h game drive. Slept in a tent which doesn¢®?t even has a light switch. You had to screw the bulb to switch on/off the light. Then morning game drive was also just 2h saying the driver needs to be on the road back to Nairobi by 9am. Maybe for unexperienced Tourists fun but I have lived in EA for more than 4 years and did many safari before. This was mos def the worst of all. They just make a lot of profit saving every shilling they can regarding service. Food was cheap local food (rice, beans, posho, goats meat) and all other services also ridiculous. The game drive was also only very semi professional. Anyway if you want local African experience, go for it but the price is definitely way to high for what you get."
Ronald,US,Visited: February 2023,10-Feb-23,50-65,2-5 safaris,Jocky Tours and Safaris,2,"Over promised, and under delivered.","The guide Joseph was fine. He was accommodating and knowledgeable.

The accommodation at Lenchada Tourist Camp was super sub-standard. 

1. I was in a single tent that looked nothing like what was presented on the website. The bathroom looked like a prison bathroom; it was unclean with plenty of cracked tiles and mold.

2. There was no Wi-Fi, even though the website promised Wi-Fi. When I inquired about the service, I was told, ""It's broken"".

3. The food service was chicken; chicken and more Fing chicken cooked the same exact way every dinner.  And it was not high-quality food. It was a buffet designed to spend the least among of money. They frequently run out of food.

4. The security was below standard. My tent zipper kept malfunctioning and would not close properly. A baboon was able to entire my tent and steal my backpack while I was on safari. Although the backpack was recovered, my clothes were spread on wet ground, plus my laptop and camera were damaged.

5. Luke warm water that you had to request be turned on.

6. Limited electricity (6:30 pm - 10:00pm and 5:30 am-7:00 am). Again, this was not disclosed in the advertisement.

7. Dirty carpet and plenty of insects.

8. A mosquito net with holes.

Not worth the $340 cash (they insisted on cash for a good reason, I would contest the charge on my card if they accepted credit or debit) I paid for three days. In short, the trip was over advertised and under provided.  "
Ronna,US,Visited: September 2018,13-Oct-18,20-35,over 5 safaris,Swahili Paradise Tours & Safaris,1,Not what was advertised,"We booked a safari to Kreuger Park in South Africa, a 4-day and 3-night stay. Our first night was in Tremisana Lodge, which is a budget lodge. The rooms were nothing fancy but were fine. The food was decent and the staff was helpful. The guides in the reserve were knowledgeable. We spent the next 2 nights at Marc's Treehouse Lodge. The treehouse experience was great, the food again was decent and the staff helpful. I was incredibly disappointed with our booking experience with Swahili Paradise. We were quoted in USD, which makes it easy for us but since the exchange rate changes we were told on arrival that we had to pay 5,000 rand more than we thought we needed to pay. We went back and forth with the woman at reception, she had to call Jimmy and clarify so that we paid what we had been quoted...which we found out was about 3,000 rand above what the price would have been if we had booked directly with Viva Safaris (the operators that actually provide the tour). We were told in our package that we would have 3 meals provided every day...the first day our pickup was at breakfast time so we didn't really expect much of anything for breakfast but we were surprised and quite irritated when we had to buy our lunch. Then on the day we went to Kreuger we again had to buy our lunch. And on the way back to Johannesburg we had to buy lunch a third time. This was simply false advertising. Also, our quote said we would have 2 full days in Kreuger park. Again, not true. We spent 1 day in Kreuger park - and we didn't even get there until after 10am (best animal viewing time is sunrise and sunset so this is TERRIBLE logistical timing). The other day that we thought we would be in Kreuger we spent 5 hours sitting at Tremisana lodge doing nothing, waiting for a short 90 minute game drive before they transferred us to Marc's camp. Incredibly disappointed that I spent >$1500 on this experience and it was not what we were told we were getting. Since then I have tried to contact Jimmy to ask about the above complaints and have received no response. This tells me that once they got our payment our experience means nothing to them. Strongly discourage you from booking with them. Do a self drive in Kreuger or book directly with Viva since they're the ones that actually service the trip. DO NOT waste your money booking with Swahili Paradise for Kreuger park. "

We had to spend a night there and really struggle to get to the lodge we had booked. The Congolese guide kept telling us that he had not received any money from Safari 2 Gorilla Tours and therefore could not pay for the services we had booked. Aaron only gave us completely idiotic excuses like Covid, no cook in the lodge (all lies, there were good staff in the lodge). Safari 2 Gorilla Tours is not recommended because they are dishonest and that is dangerous when paying in advance. 2 hours before departure we were suddenly informed of the change in accommodation, where there was no way of defending ourselves.

The trip we booked was fully options, parkfees, logies, meals etc.
When we arrived in Nairobi Peter and Peninah were waiting for us together with our driver.
They said everything was arranged for our trip.
At day 4 the troubles started, we had our lunch in a restaurant on the way to Masai Mara and the driver paid 6.000 KES for the lunch.
A hour later, the driver told me he had a call with Peter about the lunch and h said that Peter told him to ask the money back to me and that he would pay me back when we were back in Nairobi.
The same day a recieved a mail from Peter asking me to pay the parkfees for Masai Mara, Serengeti, Ngorongoro, Lake Manyara and Amboseli, because the were not payed yet.
Because we were already on our way to Masai Mara, I wrote him that I could do that if we could pay with creditcard at the entree of the park and that he would repay us whn we were back in Nairobi.
He replied, no problem.
So, we paid the park fee for Masai Mara.
Then we went to Tanzania and that driver said that they had contact with Peter and that we would pay the park fees in Tanzania.
I said , yes, if we can pay with creditcard at the gates.
That was impossible he repleid, in Tanzania the fees are paid through the travelco and you cant pay at the gates, because they have no cardreaders.
So, we drove to one ATM to another, collecting cash money, because I reached that day the maximum of cash redraw, we would do the same when we came from the Nogorongoro crater.
The amount we had to pay was also much higher than Peter wrote me in his mail.
So, I wrote Peter that same day, that I will stop paying and that he had to find a solution.
I never recieved a answer on that mail, so after visiting the crater we had to go again to ATM machines to collect the rest of the money.
When we went back to the border of Kenia, to visit Amboseli, we had to show our PCR test, but nobody told us, not Peter or the touroperator in Tanzania, that we had to do the test.
So, instead of going to Amboseli, we had to return to Arusha, to do the test.So, we lost our stay in Amboseli and we had to pay $110 for the test.
The normal price for the test is $49, but we had to pay more, because the testcenter was already closed and they found a doctor who would do the test, but only if we paid $110.
So, the day after we went back to the border and straight to Nairobi.
I sent a mail to Peter to meet us in the EKA hotel, so he could pay me back.
Once arrivbed in the hotel, a few hours later Peter, Peninah and one other lady showed up.
After explaining what we went trough and how much they owned us, the discussing started.
They did not had the money to pay us back and they told us we had to wait until they recieved money from another group that would come the second week of September.
So, after 4 hours of waiting and discussing, we had to call the tourist police.
When they arrived and because they could not explain what they did with our money we paid for our tours, they arrested them and put them in jail. Before we went of to the police station another issue popped up, even our hotel was not paid for our last night and diner.
Last week a recieved our first payment, but we are still waiting to get the rest of our money back.
What should be a splendid holiday, became a nightmare, we lost more than 4 days, first driving to one ATM machine to a other one, than because of the PCR test we never had the change to visit Amboseli and our two last days in EKA hotel, where we spend more time in the police station than in the hotel.

Roshani,AU,Visited: May 2016,29-May-16,35-50,first safari,Africa Traditional Safaris Ltd,1,"Mixed Experience, Look for Another Option","** UPDATE JUNE 2016

Since my review cannot be deleted, I would like to add the following update.  I have been refunded the amount I was owed.  

Here are some reasons for considering this company:
1. Affordable - The cost of the safari was far lower than any other company.
2. Flexibility - Joseph was flexible in terms of changing the itinerary. I was scheduled to go to visit the Hadzabe community, but decided I would prefer to go to Lake Manyara and Arusha National Park instead. Joseph was kind enough to accommodate my request.
3. Great Guide - Henry was a great guide and driver. 
4. Tented Lodges at an Affordable Price - Since it was rainy season, I did not want to camp. I stayed in tented lodges, and Joseph made it possible for me to do so. All other companies were so overpriced!  I especially appreciated staying at Rhino Lodge near Ngorongoro Crater--really nice rooms and food.
5. Airport Pickup and Drop off - Joseph sent drivers to pick me up at the airport and drop me off. 
6. Payment Options - All the companies wanted me to pay ahead of time to reserve a spot. Joseph allowed me to pay on arrival, and half in cash and half by credit card.
7. Prompt Response - Joseph was available by email and by Whatsapp. He emailed introductions to former clients in order for me to check the references for the company.

For the price and overall service, I would recommend African Traditional Safaris.



** ORIGINAL REVIEW
I contacted African Traditional Safaris through this website. I was contacted by Joseph who sent me some options for a 7 day safari. He said that I can pay half in cash and half by credit card.

I was picked up at Kilimanjaro airport and taken to an office in Arusha. There was no sign at the office, only a computer on the desk. I knew the company is not registered with the Tourist Board. I was not sure if this was a scam.

I was taken to a local hotel and picked up by a jeep the next morning.  There was one other tourist in the jeep. I was told that the amount I owed by credit card would need to be paid for park entrance fees. We went to Tarangire and I paid for the entrance for the jeep, the other tourist and me on my credit card. 

That evening we were joined by three other women who were camping along with the other tourist. They were charged a much lower amount because they were camping and were going for fewer days. I was asked to pay their entrance when we got to Serengeti, little over $400. I was essentially subsudizing their trip.

Later when I went to Arusha National Park I was asked to pay the tourist company directly and I would be reimbursed. Joseph kept making excuses and kept saying he would send me the amount by Paypal. That still has not happened a few weeks later!

Overall, I would not recommend this company. "

It was also one of the cheapest solution we've found. We thought to go a bit rustic on accommodation and transport, but we ended up having a stupid discussion about the already agreed on price. We paid in dollars, as agreed, and they started complaining something about the different exchange rate they were given. Still not sure how that would be our problem, since we had our entire booking discussion in dollars, the boss decided to close our discussion walking out on us while we were still talking. The rudest thing I've had in 40 days in Uganda, ridiculous.
The driver was nonetheless a good driver, safe, very good at spotting animals.
The car was old, with a broken window, 2 doors that wouldn't open from the inside, hanging handles, extremely dirty back seats and back window and a couple of alive chickens traveling with us in the trunk, which was actually fairly fun!
The Yebo lodge is generally speaking decent, for the price paid, placed close by both the game drive ferry and the boat ride. In our room, the toilet was leaking water and the door couldn't close. the net was slightly too small for the bed and the sheets were placed in a heart shape, which is cute, but it also meant we had to do our own bedin between sweet and unhandy, I wouldn't know what to choose!

Lastly, the vehicle had no starter -- so we had to park on a hill or get some locals to push start us.
Logistics: 45 minute delay (in a hot, dusty, crowded parking lot) while driver and chef waited for a money transfer before they could buy groceries. Tents were not arranged at the camp site, so we eventually begged some tents from other tour operators.

They misled and mistreated us and canceled one game drive.  Inappropriate way of transporting cooked chicken and food. Please send me a message to show you all the pictures, videos and emails.

Driver, so called guide: 
He drove dangerously to get us out of the park. Though we were supposed to do a game drive that morning, then transfer in the afternoon. he drove almost 70km (all recorded with our app, see below) because he had no permit after 12! He took us to our lodge at 2 and left us there, no apology and nothing.He said speak to the office blankly. The office just told us that he had explained to us on arrival. Bunch of lies and shambles! We paid for the game drive, why did we get a day of just horrible transfer that wrecked our bodies. Trust me, you can¢®?t and shouldn¢®?t drive more than 35! All poor animals in front of us getting so scared and shocked! I felt like a burden not a valuable client.
On another day we had the game drive for all afternoon, coming to the lodge in the evening. Our driver who had lost all his interest and hope of getting tipped, wanted to go back after 2 hours! We told him it is still 14 and he is supposed to go back in the evening. He said it is too hot, and there is nothing to see, there only one road full of Tsetse flies. We said he can take another route and take us to the game drive we paid. 
 I asked him to stop for the toilet break, he said there is no toilet for almost two hours and he can¢®?t stop anywhere for a bush toilet, so we have to go to the lodge which is 30 minutes away. I showed him the sign for the picnic area which was according to our map 10 minuets away. He said no, it is too far. This was unbelievably unprofessional and inhuman! As we were staying in the park, I gave him an option to take us to the lodge, then we should come back for 1 more hour game drive. That means we should be in our lodge by 17 which means evening. To our surprise he stopped in another picnic area which was less than 10 minuets away. I was shocked how he lied to us, because he had no more interest in being around us!
We saw a lion getting ready to hunt, he said no he is just going to sleep. Though, we met the other tourists in the other car was staying in our lodge and they told us why did we leave? The lion hunted the zebra after we left. He intentionally didn¢®?t want us to see anything! Good luck with the guide/ driver. I would say ask to see their certificate, but you can¢®?t see their attitude until you actually go with them .
We had unfortunately no luck with ours. First he came with a car that was falling into pieces. Then, he got angry when I told him that all our luggage is wet and my clothes, books and electronics are also wet, because the back door is broken.And also after we told him how dangerously he transports the lunch, he didn¢®?t apologiz or offered help. He only stopped and eating and talking with us. Trust me, it was a very difficult time for us. He stopped eating with us, as I mentioned above. Therefore for our lunch break, he stayed in the car, asked my partner to come out and check the bush before eating in the middle of Serengeti. He said there can be lions, leopards or snakes there. Either he was not aware or he just wanted us out of his sight. My partner asked him furiously if he has actually studied wild animals! We felt quite vulnerable and I have never seen anyone with this massive lack of conscience and professionalism.


Itinerary:
They sent an itinerary first and then they said they made a minor change only to the order of the days because one lodge was fully booked which was fair enough. We paid the money as you can see in the picture for 5 game drives, they cheated and only bought the permit for four days.
Getting the money for a game drive and not delivering it, it is not a small change. We didn¢®?t get a new itinerary or any brief that they want to save the money and wake us up at 5 am to kick us out in our lodge at 2 and call it a day! when we complained, he just follows the orders. After 3 days apart from good morning and good night, and get out for lunch, check the bush, that is what he said. Absolute disgrace!


Food:
Our fridge was not working and the door was broken and kept on flying away all the time. We can't believe that transporting food set under the sun, next to the driver, from 6 in the morning to 13, at 37 degree can be healty. How many people have touched that box, juice and banana? He had to eat it by hand, as there is no cutlery or plate! Great job, I had antibacterial gel and soap, because the place he stopped had neither toilet paper nor soap in the toilet!

We had the same story almost every day, until he gave up as well, and requested only vegetarian food. You pay as full board, you get a cooked chicken or chicken sandwich, not hot food and although I told them I am vegetarian when I booked, no one was aware, and every one looked at me with a shock on arrival . So be careful that they never communicated our special dietary requirements.


Car: 
We asked them about the car, they said in a good working condition. Look at the pictures and judge yourself . Broken door, broken fridge, no window frame rubber was left, all destroyed and the window was rattling all the way. I will put the videos on YouTube soon! The luggage were stored inside the car, because it all got wet in the back. So, we had only two seats with seatbelts that were not working. Trust me it was a torture. Our driver came with this car that the back door lock was broken and he used a robber band to close it. The rain, dust and the noise drove us mental during our time there. Our luggage was stored in the car, as all our clothing, books and electronics got wet. Well, no apology, of course! Two window locks were broken, so we had only on choice, a seat with a broken window close to all the dust coming in, see the picture below, I swear it was after one hour driving 80 km in the national park, or seat with out working seat belt. Add 36 degree to the image, without window.And my partner had to get up every now and then and close the door! Everything is recorded! We got in the middle of Serengeti, where we have seen lions 10 minuets ago.Although that all other cars in front got passed, because of the rubbish tyres we got stuck more than an hour, until we got rescued. Then he drove dangerously to get us out and not pay the fine, because the permit was till 12. 

Communication:
Unfortunately, we are left disappointed and the company hasn't even replied to us after we sent them the pictures and videos of our holiday, plus the emails providing the facts that we paid for one day game drive and got only a horrible transfer.
Before sending the videos and pictures we got this sarcastic reply from Froukje:

She wrote (I¢®?ve spoken to both Emma and Andrew about this situation. I'm very sorry to hear you're unhappy about a few things. I hope to clear a few things. We are in Africa, where the roads are rough and the nature is dusty. We are sorry you were not aware of this. These rough roads also cause the car to to be a bit noisy.)

* This way of sarcastic customer service doesn¢®?t work in this day and age. She added salt to the injury with making us feel stupid and peaky. Of course we know where you are, but we¢®?re not aware of the broken door and the fact that a driver is allowed to drive 80km/h in the national parks. I have got all of it recorded and I have tons of pictures to prove it from the app I used to record the whole way speed and location.
 We got an email after Emma saw our pictures on Facebook and our reviews. She admitted, I quote her here, email is available on request: 
(I've had a look at the car and after a very busy high season this car should have been in the garage for big mantaintance. It is at the garage at the moment. Issues like the seatbelts should have been solved earlier.What I understood the door needs to be closed in two places which the driver didn't know (normally he drives another car) and because of this it seemed broken and there was extra dust in the car. )
About food transport this was the reply: We are sorry to hear you felt sick. I understand you think it might have been the chicken. We will contact The lodge and let them know what happend and see if they received more complaints about it. We hope you're feeling better now. )

* Lets not point fingers. See the picture of how the cooked chicken was transported in 7 hours in 36 degree, next to the motor, underneath the sun. Yes, the company is there, but you have been brought up and educated in Europe. I don¢®?t want to lecture you for health , safety and hygiene. This is not the lodge fault, let me ask you a simple question, would you feed your children with that chicken?

SALIH,TR,Visited: June 2018,21-Jun-18,20-35,first safari,Jocky Tours and Safaris,1,Terrible Experience,We had a 5 day safari tour with Jocky Tour. First two days were as it was on the program but when it was our 3rd day things started to change. Driver canceled our early game drive because he simply didn¢®?t want to. When we complained he said we can discuss and never showed up (we didn¢®?t even need to discuss because we already paid for the whole thing). We let it go for the sake of the other days because we only depend on that driver and we didn¢®?t feel safe. Next day he wanted to keep our game drive short (it was till late afternoon from 7:30 am but he  wanted to finish the game drive at 10:30 and transfer us to the other location). This time we didn¢®?t want to let ot go and told him that we paid for this service and we want to stick to the program. He found it offensive and gave us attitude the rest of the trip. Last day we had a boat tour on the river and he said it wasn¢®?t included and we said he should call the office he went against it first and then he called and let us to the boat ride. This is not how it should be. No one has to fight to get the value that they already paid for and plus receive bad attitude for it. If you can get the value out of the program it would be a nice budget safari tour try not to shop from the shops in Kenya they stop frequently because they are overpriced. (you can buy the same stuff im Tanzania for almost %20 of the price tags in Kenya). Overall I would go for another tour company next time for sure (with more reviews and higher ratings) and maybe pay a little more for it. Maybe thats when you don¢®?t have to worry about if they will try to screw you somehow the next day.
Sam,IN,Visited: July 2016,04-Aug-16,20-35,first safari,Kapolondo Expeditions,2,Disappointed and let down!,"My partner and I saw the itinerary for the 11 day exclusive safari in Tanzania&Zanzibar and thought it to be exactly what we were looking for. After confirmations and having our queries answered by the tour operator Tony, we went ahead and booked. 
On the day we arrived, after having met our tour guide and Tony, we are told that the agenda for the week has been changed slightly. Reluctantly, we agree since there's nothing we could do at that point. The trip goes ahead just fine and we were meant to be on safari for 5 days spending 2 nights in one lodge/camp 2 nights in another and the last night in another. We in fact ended up staying in different lodges every night of our 5 nights there and were not told that this would be happening until when we were dropped off and told to pack our things for the next morning since we would not be staying here tonight. Completely unsettled for us to have to jump from lodge to lodge every night. We didn't know where we were going to be staying the following night, it was incredibly hard for us to relax comfortably and just enjoy the trip fully. 

The itinerary included a trip to a museum and a visit to a Masai village. The Museum was completely scrapped from the list and for the Masai village, we were told that we had to pay an additional $50 each!! After having confronted our guide about this, he too was not aware that we were even meant to be going to these places! It's as though they were trying their luck to see what they could get away with not paying or doing. After putting our foot down and talking to Tony, he arranged for these two visits to take place but we shouldn't have had to have that conversation in the first place.  

Lastly, the next leg of our trip was 5 days in Zanzibar. Before booking, we asked Tony if the package was inclusive of all meals and alcohol, he confidently responded yes that the alcohol was also apart of the package. We get to our resort in Zanzibar only to find that in fact he misled us and alcohol was not included in our reservation and so we had to pay for this out of our own pockets. 

We were very disappointed and let down by Tony and this company. All communication had seemed to be thrown about of the window, not only were we not informed about changes etc, our tour guide was also sometimes in the dark about things that was meant to be communicated to him by Tony. Nothing at all about this trip was what we expected it to be, I don't think it was worth the money we paid for it, it wasn't a luxury tour like it stated and would recommend anyone against them to avoid such disappointment.

Sammy Six,KE,Visited: September 2017,24-Oct-17,20-35,2-5 safaris,Dens Safaris,1,Dens Safaris: avoid at all costs!!,"This is an honest and complete overview of my encounters during my trip with Dens Safaris in Zambia from Sept. 1-16, 2017, which I hope will provide a meaningful insight into the practices of this company for future clients.

My itinerary was arranged and paid for back in December 2016. Initial e-mail conversations with Denver Mbewe, the owner of the company, went smooth but further questions a couple weeks before my flight to Zambia went largely unanswered. These were critical questions related to the visa requirements, malaria pills etc. I sent a few e-mails and even a message on their Facebook, which was read but never answered. The only reply I received was that I was going to be picked up at the airport and someone would be waiting with a sign with my name on it.

My personal driver and guide in South Luangwa was an unexperienced young guy aged 24 (the youngest guide in the whole national park) who was clearly not used to dealing with customers. On the second day, I was told by him to repay my park fees for my entire stay at South Luangwa, totalling $250, which I already paid in advance 10 months ago as part of my all-inclusive package. I did not receive a satisfying answer on the phone by the office manager as to why this happened, but decided to go ahead and pay in order not to waste too much time.

I was driven around the park in an old safari vehicle which had issues with the engine radiator, which repeatedly overheated. Over the course of 4 days we used up to 3 different cars, all of mediocre at best quality. To make matters worse, my guide did not even have a radio with him on any of the days he guided me and also forgot to pack water and a cooler box during many days.

On the day of transfer from the Mfuwe to Nsefu sector of the park, my guide informed me that he was going to pick up a friend of his. I was not provided with any explanation who this person was and why he was joining me on my private safari. I assumed he just wanted to catch a ride from Mfuwe to Nsefu and we were going to drop him off once we arrived in Nsefu. Upon arrival in another bush camp, it became apparent that my guide was not at all familiar with the Nsefu sector, which is why he took this guy with us, although also he had to admit he was only partly familiar with that part of the park. During one of the game drives, he thought it to be a good idea to throw some large branches at a baby crocodile (twice) so it would move and I could get a better picture of the animal. I immediately told him that this was unacceptable.

Citing obvious safety hazards, the owner of the bush camp rightfully decided to send my guide back home. She also shared with me some stories about other Dens Safaris customers she had received in the past months who were anything but happy. She herself was only briefed about my arrival a couple days before, and thought I was self-driving to the park. She then kindly proposed me to use one of their guides who was a qualified professional South Luangwa guide. The difference in the quality of guiding was starkthe number of sightings went up and I felt much safer given his possession of a radio and plentiful water and food supplies. Because of the last minute change in plans, I had to join another photographer during most of my game drives in Nsefu, and I also had to give up on all day game drives as the other guests at the bush camp paid for morning and evening game drives. Therefore, I did not get what I paid for, which was strictly a private trip consisting entirely of full day game drives.

After my stay in South Luangwa, I flew to Lusaka for a transfer to the Lower Zambezi national park. After waiting for half an hour, Denver and his office manager picked me up and drove me towards Kiambi lodge. I repeated the issues and concerns I had been facing throughout my trip, which I also e-mailed to him a couple days before. Denver acknowledged that mistakes were made but did not come up with a proposal for compensation and left me at Kiambi without communicating how he would work this out in time before my departure back home.

In Lower Zambezi I stayed at the Munyemeshi River Lodge, a self-catering lodge were I seem to have been the only guest. The lodge was under renovation and there was hardly any staff around let alone any convenient amenitiesno bar, no restaurant. My first room did not have warm water in the shower, and in fact there was hardly any water coming out of the shower head. I then had to go to another room where the shower was leaking. I stayed here during the second day with two other disgruntled Dens Safaris guests, who did the full two-day canoe tour. I dropped out after half an hour during the first day as I did not feel comfortable nor safe in the water which was infested with hippos and crocodiles. The couple mentioned to me that they had to find another guide the day after given that the first one was to drunk to wake up in the morning, which confirmed my belief once again that my safety had indeed been at risk.

During the first day game drive I was driven around by a guy who was clearly not a professional guide. His command of English was poor, he hardly spotted anything and was unable to answer my questions about the wildlife. What was worse is that he stepped on the gas and increased the speed of the safari vehicle when there were elephants blocking the road. The elephants were clearly in distress and some of them initiated mock charges at us. This happened at least three or four times and I told the driver this was unacceptable and unprofessional but he didn¢®?t care to listen. When animals associate humans with danger, this will lead to fatalities and the end of the tourism industry in Zambia.

I decided that I could not tolerate any further risk and stayed at the lodge during my last day, although another full day game drive was on the itinerary. By then I was sick and tired of the unprofessional and dangerous treatment I had received and thus had to end my trip disillusioned and disheartened. 

In summary, Dens Safaris makes you pay premium prices for subpar guidance using the cheapest people they can find, which has severe implications for your wellbeing and general safety. Therefore, DO NOT book with this company and spread this message as much as possible to prevent future malpractices.

Samuel,FR,Visited: July 2018,25-Aug-18,20-35,first safari,Bencia Africa Adventure & Safaris,1,Avoid !,"Did a Masai Mara Safari with Bencia end of July. It was supposed to be 3 days and we only spent 24 hours in the park, our guide pretending that the car broke down to force us to go to the Masai Village to force us to go to the Masai Village and to avoid paying the entry fee for another 24 hours. 
We've had to complain and got 80$ back, so that we wouldn't put a bad review online. They pretended it was the guide's fault, and told us they gave him all the cash to pay the park fees. Although the park fees can't be payed by cash.
I met later a couple who told me the same thing happened to them, so it must be a regular thing.
Later on I met two Italian guys stuck in Serengeti campsite for two days without getting on any safari because they booked with Bencia and their driver never showed up!
Avoid!"

Every day they come to pick up late, the excursions were different that we read on the tour information. The last day they don't pick up us to take to the airport, we've got to take a taxi after waiting and calling them for more than 30 minutes.  
The guides were so kindly and good, but the organitzacion was very bad."
Sandra W,CA,Visited: September 2018,04-Dec-18,50-65,first safari,Bison Safaris,1,"Misleading and sub contracts out without telling you in advance. Be advised, I was also harassed","Unless you are on a private tour and paying big bucks then don't be misled.

They will tell you anything you want to hear, and have good communication. But if you think you are joining one of their safaris, then be advised that they sub contract out to unqualified and poorly organized drivers who work for other budget companies like Bon Fire Adventures. You may be in a van with people from 5 other budget safari companies with different itinaries then you. 
Because the driver was juggling different itineraries, he tried to change mine and when I didn't want to stay in a differant lodge, he pitted me against other guest whom one harassed me along with himself. 
I lost out on 2  drives as a result. 
At 60 years old this was not the safari experience I was hoping for. 
They advertise professional driver/guide. The driver was neither. He drove 90% of the time on his cell phone both on the highway and in the park. He had a broken pair of binoculars and only relied on other drivers to tell him where the animals were. This may be ok for young travellers, but I did not feel safe and he was aware of this but continued.
Bison tours would not offer any compensation and did not care about my safety with the two men who were harassing me. 
If you plan on joining a safari if you are alone or a couple do not go with Bison or Bon Fire or other operators that don't have their own van and sub contract out. Also make sure that everyone is staying in the same location and on the same itinerary.

Poor execution and under-delivery of what has been agreed and paid for are my two biggest pain-points with drive tanzania ltd. Even if the company had provided as advertised, I would still not recommend it due to poor overall service (last-minute arrangement and changes), lack of tour briefing (we have to ask what's going on all the time) and the tour guides are not helpful.


So the whole impression was very bad, they were trying to deceive us every time they got a chance. So thank you, Yoeni Japheth  for the spoilt safari and first impression about Tanzania. You're not even think for the future, I told you that if we'd love the safari we'd definitely go with your company fot the northern curcuit. And thanks God we found another great company with honest and pleasant people working there who changed our opinion to the country and people. We went back home absolutely satisfied and pleased. Tanzania is amazing!

We have all scans, documents, photos, programs, witnesses to prove my words. So, guys, be aware of that company and Yoeni Japheth . Actually we can even bring an action for the court, because they rendered their service not loke it was claimed in the contract and forced us to pay more money cheating us with accommodation."

2- We booked for private game ride but one day in Masai Mara another car broke down, the driver asked us if we can help them to get them to their hotel, we said its ok but we ended up whole day with 5 people in our car. They completely ruined 1 day of our trip. When we complained the agency sincerely apologized and said it will not happen again. We asked for refund for 1 day but they refused. 
3- The driver was just a driver, he didn't know anything about the animals, nature or culture, this waisted lots of our time.
4- The last accomodation had nothing in common with pictures, the rooms were absolutely dirty, it seemed they never washed them since they built the camp. No internet access although wifi signal was available.

People are nice but the owner is not a trustworthy person.

Guides are amazing and they are responsible to their job. The guide, Emanuel was strong, responsible and always cheered us up. The assistant guide, Shukuru  was full of knowledge about nature. The trekking itself was an amazing experience with amazing guides and porters.

However, we paid our hut fee($165 for two of us) through credit card but one of them was cancelled so we tried it again with a different credit card. After that, we found out that the payments were withdrawn double. Thus, we asked the manager to get the refund but he rejected and denied that there is no double withdrawal.
Moreover, he called us THEFT. I don¢®?t understand why he can tell there is not double withdrawal and I am not comfortable with being called ¢®¡Ætheft¢®¡¾

It poured rain on the way home (a 6 hour drive) and because the car was so poorly functioning, it also rained inside the car and we got soaken wet. The hotel we stayed at was also very sketchy. They advertised air conditioning but the one in my room was broken, the shower barely worked with just a trickle coming out. Overall, not a good experience."
Sarah,IE,Visited: September 2017,22-Sep-17,35-50,first safari,Ancient Wild Safaris,1,Do not book with Ancient Wild Safaris,"What was meant to be an amazing experience was tainted by our experience with Ancient Wild Safaris.

Fortunately we didn¢®?t let the complete lack of management ruin our trip however it added an immense amount of stress to what was meant to be a relaxing break from work. 

There was not a day that went by that I wasn¢®?t worried about the next part of the journey and spent my time trying to get in contact with you or information from you.

I had started to get concerned before we left when I had to continually chase up the details and request copies of tickets and bookings. We were assured everything was in place and that a file of the printouts would be provided in Nairobi. It wasn¢®?t.
1.	Our 1st driver thought he was taking us back to Nairobi and it wasn¢®?t until he asked how many days we were staying in Nairobi after Amboseli that he called and was made aware he was driving us to Lake Nakuru
2.	After chasing and chasing on the booking receipts we needed one of your team met us before we flew to Mara and promised that we would get a copy of the remaining documents we needed at Neptune. I made it clear at this time that I was not happy and that you should be making sure I had them emailed to me
3.	Our 2nd driver who was meant to pick us up from the airstrip didn¢®?t show up - he had been sent to a different airstrip
4.	The Masai village experience was terrible. We paid the 100 USD each and then they tried to charge us 450 USD for souvenirs. They then also asked for money for their school. All in all it was a 600 USD excursion and not worth it one bit.
5.	Our 3rd driver was not aware of when we were flying out to Zanzibar and neither were we as we still didn¢®?t have any flight details
6.	I called and emailed a number of times once we reach Ngorongoro as again there were not details as to our flight the next day
7.	Your manager on the ground in Tanzania said he would meet us before we got to the airport. He didn¢®?t. He then asked us to come to the office. He then called and said he would send someone to the airport. 20 mins later still no one. The driver called again and he then said he would send ticket numbers through. Another 20 mins and no ticket numbers. The driver then called back again and was told to take us inside even though we had no tickets to show the security.
8.	We then arrive in Zanzibar and there is no driver - we have to pay 60 USD on top of what we had paid you for the transfer and arrange a driver ourselves 
9.	We then get to the hotel and they ask for our booking voucher which we didn¢®?t have as we still had not been provided any details in paper or email form
10.	The new contact in Zanizbar, Kondo, then called and was at that time the 1st person who had actually apologised for any of this - there had been no apology from Mike and his team at Ancient Wild Safaris only excuses and blame pointed to the Tanzania operations 
11.	Kondo again apologised as he was not able to get us the VIP seats that should have been booked for us on the Ferry on the way back - if this had been organised properly and booked when we paid our deposit then we would have had the VIP seats we wanted 
12.	Thank fully there was a man with a sign to meet us in Dar es Salam which was a relief¢®?¢®?this was no thanks to Ancient Wild Safaris but to Kondo and his  company who had taken over managing the last part of our trip.

Sarah,KE,Visited: July 2019,03-Aug-19,20-35,first safari,Kenya Walking Survivors Safaris Ltd,1,BEWARE: Please do not book before reading this!!,"When my mom and I agreed we wanted to come to Africa this year, I contacted multiple safari companies. Kenya Walking (KW) was the fastest to respond. I also chose to go with them because they are local, the reviews online seemed great, and it was in our budget. We paid half then, and half when we got here on July 17th. We were supposed to have a 15 day Kenya and Tanzania trip. 

Our first 10 days, all in Kenya, were fantastic. We were very satisfied with the experience and nothing went wrong. However, on our 11th day, when we were supposed to go to Tanzania, everything dissolved into chaos. The driver who was supposed to pick us up at the border was not there. There was a group before us to told us they had been waiting at the border a day, and they did eventually get picked up. We were worried, but we waited there like the company told us to do. KW kept saying they would be there shortly. After hours in the hot car, we finally went to the hotel. KW told us to get a room there (we paid for it), and that the driver would arrive in the morning. The next day, after calling and waiting for hours, still no driver. KW hung up on me and then just stopped answering the phone. 

We were finally picked up, just as we were leaving to go back to Amboseli, and taken to Tanzania. The next 5 days there ( we stayed a day extra because of all this) were awful. No permits, hotels, or meals were paid for. We would be waiting at the park gate for hours until either a permit came through, or we paid for it ourselves (it is way more expensive to pay for permits yourself. we paid $280 just to get into serengeti). There were a couple middle men between KW and us, and all of them were calling us telling us a different story or a different plan. The hotels we did stay at, we either paid for or the owner let us stay there, despite not being paid yet. Of our 5 days in Tanzania, only 1 was very good, and we had to pay for hotels that night. Between my mom and I, KW had been paid $440 each day for us to be there. That money was nowhere to be seen. I soon found out the likely cause

Fortunately, getting back to Nairobi was smooth. There was a driver there to pick us up. By this time, I had peiced together some of the story. Our driver then told me the rest. 

KW is run by a guy named OT. Last year, OT apparently spent the equivalent of $500,000 on a peice of land with tourist money. He thought the land investment would return a profit by the time the tourists arrived in june/july. The guy who sold him the land was a conman, and the money was lost. So, clients were stuck in the same situation. At the time, OT had his tour company license taken away. Somehow, perhaps with a bribe, he got it back. He also seems to have doctored his reviews online (there is warning on trip adviser now about it). This year, it seems he may have done something similar, lost all the company's money. This disaster unfolded starting on Saturday, July 28th, when the group before us got stuck at the border. It has been one week since then, and now the company's website is down, multiple guests (including myself) have filed reports in the Kenya Police office and with the Kenya Tourist Police, and the drivers are doing the same because they have not been paid. Our drivers were so kind, I feel terrible that they have not received compensation for their time and work, as this is their livelihood. I was also told there are 16 people stuck at the Tanzanian border, and more tour groups stuck around the country. We received an email from KW promising to refund us by certain dates later this year, but I have doubts that will happen. 

What a terrible situation that has impacted so many people. We feel fortunate that this didn't happen before we got here or right after, because we did have a great first 10 days.

Sarat Babu,US,Visited: July 2023,30-Jul-23,35-50,first safari,Terrain Tanzania Safaris,1,Horrible experience,"We booked this company for both Kenya and Tanzania safaris, They completely spoiled our Kenya Masai Mara experience, the guide we got  name called Ole spoiled our complete experience by misguiding us and when we tried to call the tour company owner George, he was not at all responsive while we were in Kenya.

They treated us well while we were in Tanzania got a very good guide name called Omar but our Kenya and Masai Mara experience was horrible.
And when we were suppose to get AA Lodge at Ambosali National park, they gave one basic room where it was not a finished room with open nails and all, the beds were not even equipped with mosquito nets and my kids were bitten by at least 50 Mosquitos on that night.

Summary: Our experience in Tanzania is ok but definitely spoiled my Kenya experience.

I recommend you to avoid this company."
Sascha,DE,Visited: August 2023,24-Aug-23,50-65,2-5 safaris,African Breeze Tours,2,Messing up accomodations,"Best experience of our safari was with our guide Isaac. He is a safe driver, very good game spotter and a lovely fellow. Asante sana to him.

With the accomodations Kate was supposed to organize we were not so lucky and happy.

We did the 7 day's safari with drop off at kenyan coast.

About 8 months prior we agreed with her on an itinerary that was finally matching the offer on safaribookings.com in terms of accomodations.

We paid her the deposit of 25% to make all the reservations.

When we arrived in Nairobi we've found out that there were just reservations made for the first 3 night's!

The rest of the hotels such as Sentrim Amboseli, Ngulia Lodge and Voi were not booked for us but completely full at that time in high season.

Kate is a very emotional person and was very pissed that we've found out about that prior.

We belived her to get us the acomodations of our intinerary as she promissed once again. So we paid the 75% balance of the tour in cash on the day we started, just as agreed prior.

We started without knowing where we would stay the other night's. For most of them she found somehow comparable stay's. 

Except for one night. We had to stay in a 
lowest budget sh*ty zero star place called ""Kilimanjaro Cottages Amboseli"" https://www.google.com/travel/hotels/s/3yQTuqmxLhfF4mkE8
 instead of the exclusive Sentrim Amboseli Lodge, https://sentrim-amboseli-lodge.hotel-mix.de/

We requested a refund of 150$ for that.
She did not refund for that!
We didn't tip for that.
We told her to give the refund straight to the driver, so everyone is happy again.

She didn't.

We can not recommend to book through her.

During our shortened time at the Elephant Orphanage, we were delayed by an argument our driver had with the caretakers of the Orphanage. He apparently was trying to sneak another van full of people in under our reservation. We got this from the caretakers. As a result we missed the feeding of the baby elephants. After initially complaining about this to Viator, we noticed the description on the website had changed to 1 Hour Giraffes, 1 Hour Elephants, and 1 Hour Bead Factory. Funny thing is this is a 6 hour tour and not sure where 3 hours of transport would come from? As it was in the original description there was two hours of transport allocated. Overall a Bait and Switch and some unethical behavior from the driver. Clearly they know something was wrong because they changed the description. Good thing we had taken screen shots of the original tour we booked! Viator was no real help in resolving and by the way, they are a Trip Advisor company and you may want to look at their Yelp reviews, NOT GOOD!"

They take no pride in making your experience memorable. The driver was 3 hours late picking me up and then proceeded to rush me through the whole experience. (Even after the trip I waited an hour and a half to get picked up for Nakuru) After speaking with management about my problems, they proceeded to tell me I should have received 15 hours inside the park, but I was only in there for less than 10 hours. The boss refused to apologize and offered no compensation because the other customer ""had no problems"". He then lied to me that he wasn't the boss and the boss was ""on holiday"" even though he was right there in the room. Pega could care less about customer satisfaction; therefore I do not recommend!"
Sean,IT,Visited: July 2018,20-Sep-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Cardboard Box Travel Shop,1,"Broken head and eyeglasses, downgraded to poorer accommodation, standard scams with optionals etc...","We encountered:

- one broken head and eyeglasses

During the exit from the 4x4 vehicle at DINE 45, the driver opened all doors that could rotate 180 degrees and did not secure them. The back door curved and hit the head of my colleague who had already come out of the vehicle and then crash his glasses and he got hematoma on his head. This only happened due to negligence of drivers and guides. We have seen other drivers unloading passengers and holdin the doors in place so that a similar problem would not happen. 

- downgraded to poorer accommodation

When we booked the trip, they confirmed our stay (2 days) at Namibia Desert Lodge and instead we were in a campsite with no internet in anything that looked like a tent.

- standard scams with optionals

During the trip we went to a lodge where we were told we could go and watch some wild animals in the cage. They did not let us know that we had to pay for it. Only later, they asked us to pay about $ 10 per person. Everybody in the group was surprised and the guide later said he warned us that we could watch animals ""only if we want."" But he did not say that if we want we have to pay for it and that this activity is not included.

- a minibus that was constantly drowned

They have been late for more than 1 hour when taking over the hotel for the first day. Explanation: Vehicle problem. I do not know what they did in those hours, but the vehicle we were on for 6 days and over 2000 km was a permanent breakdown and it was not pleasant to stay in the middle of the road with a broken vehicle and the first village 100 km away.

- we were stolen money from the minibus while there was no one around the minibus, only the driver

The last day, only a 2 hours before the end of the trip, we stopped at a lodge for lunch. Until then, the drivers (who is also the guide) was always sitting during the lunch and the dinner with us (group of 7) at the same table. This time not. We were alone in a restaurant inside the lodge, there were no people around. The driver moved away from the group. We left inside the minibus a bag with my colleague's wallet. The money was stolen from the wallet: not all the money was stolen, but only a few large banknotes. We realised this when arrived to the hotel.

I asked the agency to give me an explanation on these issues (and many other things I did not even mentioned here) but they mostly refuse responsibility. I demanded a refund and I told them that if they decided to make a refund, that would be to the account of the humanitarian organisation I will indicate to them. I do not want a refund, but someone who has accomplished this kind of service needs to bear responsibility for it. Apart from the agency I will write more reviews on the internet, it is even more a responsibility of the tour operator (SWA SAFARI). 

Sorry for my bad english but I will write other reports on Italian and Spanish (my mother tongues)."

As of today, 1/6/2016, we have not been reimbursed for our additional expenses, US $ 4,461, which we occurred due to Steve Biko's continued failings, and have not heard back from Mr. Biko. 
Our safari was scheduled, Aug. 16 - Aug. 22, 2015. Day 1, we were not picked up as scheduled in Nairobi to continue to Masai Mara. The hotel arranged for transfer to Wilson Airport and from there we flew to Masai Mara. Upon arrival and being greeted by our driver, we were told our park fees, driver and car fees had not been paid. After waiting around and phoning with Mr. Biko, we were off to go about 1 hour after arriving. Day 3 our scheduled balloon ride did not happen. Day 4 we were supposed to continue to Serengeti, and were denied boarding the SafariLink plane due to Mr. Biko had failed to pay for the tickets. On day 5 after not being able to leave our hotel  due to Mr. Biko not paying for our lodging, our family of four had no other option than to change our itinerary for the remaining day's. This cost us an additional $4,461 for accommodation and flights, not to mention the time we missed actually being out seeing animals, and instead dealt with the many failings of Steve Biko and a police report encouraged my the Manager of our hotel, who wants this type of scoundrels out of the Kenyan travel industry. Throughout our safari when running into unpaid services,  Steve Biko continuously asked us to pay in order to be reimbursed later - we did not as our safari was paid in full well in advance.
With the experience and knowledge I have today, my advice to you would be to organize your own safari. It might seem overwhelming, but you can book your flights and hotels directly, and arrange for a car with knowledgeable drivers with the hotel you are staying at. Enjoy your travels, and stay away from Steve Biko and Africa Remote Safaris.  "
Sebastian,CA,Visited: February 2016,29-Mar-16,20-35,2-5 safaris,Experience Kenya Tours and Travel,1,Beware of this provider's rip off methods,"Let's talk about the positive aspects firstThe driver was nice and had practical knowledge of most animals and plants we were passing by. I sometimes wished he was a little more involved with us and our Safari rather than ""doing business"" on his mobile phone. So we did see all the animals we were expecting to see and also learned their names...

However I would not recommend booking any tour with this provider (Experience Kenya aka Bianka Investment aka Eric Nyankanga). Eric tried to rip us off several times and in the end he succeeded. Here's the story:

1.) Although the tours here on SafariBookings include ""All Taxes/VAT"", our first quote had the VAT listed on top of the initial price.
2.) After having booked and payed, one lodge (for two nights) was changed into a cheaper one (e.g. not having 24/7 electricity). The reason given was that the initially booked lodge could not cater vegetarian food, which is hard to believe since you get veggy meals everywhere in Kenya).
3.) ""Park fees"" listed as included on this site were silently removed in the quote, where these fees - according to Eric - are under ""Any other item not mentioned"". This did cost us additional 800 USD.

ConclusionPay a little bit more for your tour and avoid being screwed. We did so on our second Safari one week later and the experience was completely different."
Sebastian,US,Visited: October 2016,16-Nov-16,20-35,first safari,Tembea East Africa Safaris,1,"Horrible experience, they cheated on the service and stole money","Through safari booking we contacted Tembea East Africa Safaris, and at beginning everything worked perfect; Responded to our emails immediately and also we managed all the details to make our trip perfect. We were also quoted in another company that had been recommended by a friend from Chile, but we finally opted for this, as they looked like a serious company and was also ""backed up"" by Safari Booking.


The first problem we had was closing the payment method, because although on its page expressly shows that you can pay by Pay Pal, they told us that we could not pay that way, since for them it was very expensive the commission, So we had to pay with Western Union. We were scared with this response, so we told them that we could not take the Safari with them, but seeing that we were hesitant, Evangelina (Tambea East) immediately wrote to us saying that finally there was no problem and we could pay with pay pal If we wanted.

Thus, we agreed with them that we would pay the total of the tour with Pay Pal equivalent to 4,590 USD (50% before arriving and 50% when arriving there) and we were assured by mail that we would have no problems with that. Once this was closed, Evangelina started sending us several emails, noting that we had to pay 50% as soon as possible, because they had to buy airline tickets and book hotels with that money, otherwise if we delayed they could being full the hotels we had specially selected.

So in a few days we paid through Pay Pal 50% (2,295 USD) of the tour in advance (this was two months in advance). The tour included tickets from Dar Es Salaam to Zanzibar and from Zanzibar to Arusha, all hotels, all transfers, safari (guide and car) and almost all meals. That is to say, we would arrive in Tanzania, pay the remaining 50% with Pay Pal (2,295 USD) and we would just enjoy ourselves, without having to worry about anything, or to spend an extra coin.

But this was what actually happened:

1)	Upon arriving in Tanzania, they told us that we can not pay the remaining 50% with Pay Pal, because they are out of their annual quota to receive payments there (clearly a lie since that does not exist) and tell us that we have to go paying in different places with the credit card as they tell us. This already annoyed us quite a bit, but we preferred not to complain to not ruin our holiday.

2)	Upon arriving in Zanzibar, it was supposed to be arranged a transfer to pick us up and take us to our hotel which was 1.5 hours away. We were waiting for 40 minutes at the airport, it was night without anyone appearing, so we had to pay a taxi to take us to the hotel.

3)	Once in Zanzibar, Evangenila sends us for whatsapp a list of places we have to pay ourselves upon arrival (some hotels and entrances to the parks, which were supposed to be reserved and had to be paid by them) and tell us That the rest (what is missing to complement the remaining 50%) we have to pay in cash, although they had expressly agreed that that would not happen because we were not going to carry cash on our trip.

Although we claimed and said that we were not going to pay in cash, as we took out a high commission in our country and we had agreed that we would pay with Pay Pal (there was already a claim on Safari Booking against this company For the same issue, so we were especially careful to confirm that we could pay with Pay Pal), we were told there was no other option, so we were afraid to miss the safari, ande we had to accept it.

4)	Arriving in Arusha in Tanzania, as soon as we arrived we were taken to a bank, where we could not withdraw money, then in the afternoon they pick us up again at the hotel to go to another bank, in this place the exchange rate was Very high, so they wanted us to go to a third bank. At that moment I was enraged, seeing that I was using a whole day of my vacations to go to different banks instead of enjoying, so I told them that I would not go to any other bank. At that time talk directly to Issa (owner of Tembea East), who finally agreed to change the money there.

We gave them $ 899 in cash, supposedly with that money plus the payment of Planet Lodge hotels, Octagon Lodge, Tortilis Camps and tickets to the parks of Manyara Lake and Serengeti (1,396 USD), it was all paid for.

5)	It was already quite annoying, to change all the same day we arrived, when we could not do anything else, and having to go paying in different places, when supposedly the grace to do this through an agency is that you pay and You forget those issues, which was what we had agreed upon. It was quite uncomfortable, since in some places the card did not work and in the parks we were the only ones doing the line, since all the other companies - as it has to be - the tourists only enjoyed and it was the company that was in charge of all the payments.

6)	As for Safari itself, they hired a guide they did not even know and who had never worked with them, they hired him through a third party, so the guide did not even know the operators. That is, Tambea East had no idea who they were sending us to do the Safari (according to the guide told us), or in which car we were going to do. Luckily, within all of the poor organization, our guide was quite good and we quite enjoyed the walks with him. The problems always came in the afternoon, when tired after the Safari we had to go to the hotel.

7)	The first hotel we had problems was at Tortillis Camp, as Issa (Owner of Tembea East) called us the same day we were going to Serengeti, to inform us that there was no available space at Tortilis Camp, lodge we had specially selected and for which we had even paid More (it was more expensive), so we had to go to another hotel. He only called us to communicate this, without explanation, to see if we agreed with the change, or to apologize for the incident.

This was advised on the same day that we had to go to the lodge, so we realized that they had never actually made any reservations and the 50% that we paid in advance at an early start had simply been left for them.

We realized that they were booking the hotels the day before or sometimes the same day that we were going to get to the hotel, even though we supposedly had paid 50% months in advance so they could make reservations.

In short, what happened was that they did absolutely nothing, simply received our money and stayed with it, without using it in making reservations or paying the plane tickets (also was bought the same day).


That is, the urgency of paying 50% was not to make the reservations, but because they needed the money.

8)	But worst of all, it was not just what happened. In Ngorongoro when we arrived at the hotel which supposedly had already been paid directly with our money for Tembea East, we found out that Tembea had never actually paid and had just made the reservation that same day, by an email in which they told the hotel ""That if they (Tembea) did not pay before we arrived at the hotel, they would charge us directly upon arrival."" This was according to what the manager himself showed us. (Attach mail that Tembea East sent to Norongoto Farm House)

In the desperate place, we spent hours trying to contact someone at the agency, but they simply did not answer our calls, they didn??t respond to our messages, and the guide could not help us, since he had only been subcontracted and had no idea what was happening. Besides, he told us that he had not been paid from Tembea East either, which was due to him for the safari he was doing to us, so he was also very worried.

Finally, unable to do anything else, we had to pay again 266 USD for the hotel we had already paid to Tembea.

Then, from what happened to us in the first hotel, they sent us a message saying that we were not worried, that it was just a confusion (even though the mail they sent to the hotel was very clear) and they were going to give us back what we had paid . We were also assured that at the next hotel (Moromboi) everything was already paid, as well as the tickets to Tarangire National Park. Supposedly they had given the money to the guide, but this one told us that he had not received anything.

Upon arriving at the park, they obviously had not transferred anything to the guide, so we had to pay 119.18 USD for park fees again and the same thing happened at Maramboi Lodge, where the manager told us that they had only received half the payment ( That same day) and that they had been told that the other half would charge us when we arrived, so we had to pay 141 USD.

9)	So finally with more than 535 USD we had to pay extra (although we had already paid Tembea for it), we arrived in Arusha on the last day, where we were supposed to meet with the representative of Tembea in Tanzania, who would give us back the money.

We asked all day waiting for it to arrive, instead of being able to enjoy the city, besides with the heart in the mouth, not knowing if they were going to pay us what they owed us or not. Evidently, after all the lies, we no longer trusted the agency at all. We were very scared, stressed, angry and tired of everything that happened.

Shortly before we left for the airport, they refunded us USD 350, remaining with the rest of the money which was USD 185 (which they supposedly could not transfer due to bank problems, even though they knew perfectly everything we had to pay extra since the previous day).

We have a whatsapp from Tembea East representative in Zimbabwe where he tells us that we owe 185 USD.

10)	In short, they ruined our holidays, they cheated us because they never made reservations or provided any service (on the contrary, we only had different problems each day) and finally they stole more than 185 USD that we have not receive yet until today.

Everything we tell you, is backed up, with the payments, emails, messages by whatsapp and with the testimonies of all the people who witnessed this; The person they contacted in Tanzania as an intermediary, the guide they hired and the managers of the different hotels, who personally witnessed how we had been cheated.

We believe it is unlikely that such a company is part of the companies that appear on its website. Not only they did not do the work (they did not book, they did not plan, nothing!), They cheated and robbed us.

We trusted in your website (Safari Booking) and that's why we thought Tembea East was a serious company, because we thought your web site at least verified that the companies were reliable.

It is not enough in this case to put our comment about the operator on your page, but we ask you to take that company out of its publications, because we do not want anyone to happen again what happened to us.

We will not rest until this is made public so that the people who travel do not have to live such an experience. If you offer the service, you should at least check with which companies they work or which companies they publish.

I Booked a 7 day Private tour safari through them in September, I paid $5000 for this.  One, our driver was terrible, he did not give us any information or facts, like a tour guide should do.  When we would ask to stop to see wildlife he would ignore us and keep driving, but he would stop and talk to every other tour guide we passed.  It was like we were on HIS time.  When we got to the serengeti park entrance the drivers card to pay the park fees & lodging declined.  Now I have already paid for this in advance so where is that money?.....they asked me to use my card and William Amon promised he would pay me in cash when we returned from the park. We had paid $530 to stay at the Ngorogoro Crater hotel which we did not get to stay in.  Again, something I had already paid for.  I had one request throughout the entire safari (booking a private tour they advertise you can change the itinerary to your needs, apparently not true), William had promised he would make it happen, then it was excuse after excuse as to why he could not do what I asked & it was a simple request. Our driver got fined while in the park, and that somehow was my fault.  I should not have to get into an argument with the driver and William while on vacation. That is not what you expect or pay for.
They advertise ice cold water to drink throughout the safari.  The so called cooler in the vehicle does not work. Since Sept 16th I have been trying to get refunded the $1100 William Amon & Bramwell Safaris owe me and I have gotten nothing but excuses.  Originally he said he wired the money & it would hit in 7 business days.  7 days later of course no money, I emailed him and he said something went wrong......Yeah, bank wires do not go through if you do not have any money!!!!!

Here is our story: 
We contacted this guy Eric who is the owner of Tracks Berg Travel couples of weeks ago before our trip to Kenya on the 21st Feb 2019. He replied to all my emails with a price of $580 which including pick up service on the 21st Feb, girafe center visit, and 25-26th trip to Nakuru with game drive and one night hotel, as we need to leave Nairobi on the 26th noon time back to airport. 

He came and picked us at the airport on the 21st with a driver in a silver old car, and we paid him $400 cash as I said I would pay him the remaining amount by 25th when we meet again to Nakuru. 

He was still reachable by 24th evening through the phone and promised he would pick us in our hotel Nairobi and drive us to Nakuru on the 25th morning 7:30am. We waited for about 2 hours in the morning and nobody came...we called him and emailed him, his phone was off all the time and never reply to our emails...we have to take taxi to his office which claimed to be at Vision Plaza, Mombasa on his website and the attached receipt, which it turned out to be a fake company, there¢®?s no such office at all there, we wasted another 3 hours to search around and have to report this to the police! 

It is such a nightmare for us as we planed our two last days in Nakuru to enjoy our last moment here, but we have to stay in Nairobi from 25-26th calling and visiting police and searching for him. Eric Muchai is a cheater, liar and scammer! Everything he said is fake, there¢®?s no office, no driver, no booking to hotel (as we called the hotel in Nakuru that he said he booked, the hotel told us there¢®?s no booking under us or him...). We are very disappointed and surprised to see there¢®?s such company / people would scam tourists in Kenya. Hope the police can find him very soon as what we saw, this is not the first time he is scamming tourists. 

The trip ended up unpleasant wasting our time and money, and we want to make sure NOBODY ELSE WOULD EVER BOOK WITH HIM ANYMORE! It is a SCAM and avoid this company and Eric forever!!! "
Sergio,IN,Visited: November 2016,02-Dec-16,35-50,first safari,Ancient Wild Safaris,1,Didn't get what I paid for!,"I have booked a three days and two nights private safari to Amboseli National Park.
On our way to Amboseli the car broke down (I understand it happens). We waited for a taxi to take us to the park and then we finally joined a couple who was on a private safari and not so happy to have other people joining their safari. 
For me it was my first safari and I ended up seeing a lot of wildlife and the car wasn't even stopping or explaining anything (it wasn't my safari of course).
The next day I had my own plan but since I had no car and no guide (that I very much paid for). I joined the same couple again and I had to comply with their plan. At 8am on the second day I returned to the hotel after a morning drive and until 5pm I had nothing to do! This day I wanted to do a full day game drive but again, no car and no guide and most of all no words from Michael. He didn't try to call me even once (despite he had my kenyan number or he could have contacted the hotel). I wasted a whole day and no apologies were presented nor different activities were planned for me. Simply nothing, just abandoned. 
At 5pm Joseph the guide finally arrives after fixing the car and took me on a game drive (1 hour). The drive was awful as we only had 1 hour before the park closed. So we couldn't go deep inside the park.
On our last day we had finally one proper game drive (one out of the 4 we paid for).
Again we contacted Michael and tried to get him to meet us in Nairobi. He agreed and then once in nairobi, of course he was not available. 
He apologized over the phone but I wanted a partial refund. I paid a very expensive private safari with a private guide. I didn't get what I paid for at all and then he tried to talk about religion and making excuses. 
They don't don't how to deal with customers and I practically paid $540 for a 3 days private safari with 4 game drives (I got one real game drive). As my first safari experience it was awful and it was disrespectful to be treated this way. "
sergio navarro,ES,Visited: October 2017,17-Dec-17,50-65,over 5 safaris,Bush Baby Calls,1,DANGER!! A genuine Swindle of touroperator in Bostwana.,"The worst safari ever!!
Last October we went away to Bostwana a group of 6 persons in a safari of 13 days, 12 nights. We contract months before across the local agency Bush Baby Calls LTD since the price that offered us for the itinerary for that we look was not bad (The major mistake that we committed). His manager, such a Mogakolodi Serumola, was the one who was answering to our post office on our doubts. To reserve he asked us for an anticipation of 50 % of the price of the safari. Hitherto all good, but when we come there everything was from bad to worse and almost at all it was adjusting to what we contract. Our safari would begin in victory Falls and from there we would go to the Kalahari to be rising for the Delta of the Okavango. The manager, a scoundrel, only faced the consequences the day of beginning of the safari to appear and, overcoat, to take the rest of the money. Then it never faced the consequences in spite of living through situations of extreme gravity. Always he was throwing the fault to his workers. (In spite of being whom I receive and with whom we contract, the very inept one was exempting his responsibilities blaming his workers as if his workers were not of his responsibility).
To begin, the first day took from us the food that was included (also we had to pay to us of our pocket the breakfast in the hotel K1 in spite of being included in the price). It did us to lodge at Matswere Gate's very same entry and not at the approved camping. It made us encamp opposite a few destroyed and sickening baths riddled with scorpions and spiders (we have photos). In addition one of the clients was a major person and we ask him expressly that we wanted the shop of encamping with bath in his interior since this person was needing in the nights of going to the bath. It ignored and this 70-year-old person, I spend an authentic Calvary every night. His workers were excusing themselves of everything and were sending us to speaking with the manager, such a Mogakolodi Serumola that was never giving solutions and was escaping of everything. For limit, the land rover that gave to us (a land cruiser) defective wine with the ruadas in poor condition (even that of supply). In the first days the wheels failed in diverse occasions and we lost a lot of time changing them. In a safari you can puncture because it is normal; what is not normal is to come already of before hand with all the ruined ruadas, especially when the voyage for the country was going to be hard. But the worse thing was for coming, to the third day we were preparing to leave the desert to go to Moremi and they returned to trump the tyres. They left wire drawing us in the middle of the desert more than 4 hours.! Without water or coverage to call nobody!! He had to be a companion the fact that sim was giving his card to the driver in order that it could call the manager because none of the workers had balance. After a few hours ms late, the manager us tarjo a wheel to be able to go out of there (they were trumping 3 wheels and only it us brought one). We ask for explanations him for the condition of the car and of our safari of evening in Moremi that we it had lost since we do not come in time to the reservation and he said to us that we should not worry that we would do safari by night. Obviously it was a lie. We did not do safari not in the evening not by night in spite of having paid them. This it was the last time that we saw the manager. Nevermore it faced the consequences in spite of the multiple incidents that we would continue having and his vague promises of which it would be there or it is. A person's fraud.
We come to Moremi and, not only we did not do safari of evening by night since it us nor had promised, if not that the camp was a disaster. The showers had not even water. In spite of being almost 5 hours thrown in the desert of the Kalahari more the distance that we had to cross there was no water in the showers. The minimal thing that it is necessary to to do before sending a few clients to a place (independently of what they pay) is to make sure that expires with the minimal services. It did not even do it. It had clear that it was not going to face the consequences and his employees were not moving a finger invoking that they did not know anything. Everything was a disaster. We were thinking that already at all it could go to worse. And we are wrong.The car was continuing so bad. Stopping every little for the condition of the wheels. They promised us to change it when we were coming to Maun and, again, they us lied. They did not do it.
In Khwai it happened a little that I do not wish anybody. Already everything was a disaster. This man had ruined the vacations and it never faced the consequences. When we come to the area of Khwai proceeding Moremi's, we did safari in route until there came the hour of returning to the camp. The case is that for very incredible that it seems ¢®?! We never come!. The chauffeur put to look for the camp and ¢®? he did not find it. It started raining, key the night and the driver continued turning looking for the camp and ¢®?! Nothing!. The people started becoming very nervous until it made clear to us that he was not finding the campsite, which was not where it had to be. It was a closed night, was raining and was not giving us solutions. We demand to speak with the manager and it was not answering this one to the telephone. It gave an assault to a companion of stress. Finally it stopped in a position of rangers to explain the situation to them and for our surprise and without saying anything to us, a land rover was raised and left with them.

Lie did not pay them (we have the income to the park) again, ever. 
In end, a hell of trip with a disastrous company. The worse thing through that I have never lived in my trips. A manager who is a scoundrel and a compulsive liar. Flee of this company. Do not leave you to be deceptive either for his initial comity or for his prices. The cheap thing works out expensive (to us very expensive).

Shannan,US,Visited: January 2019,01-Feb-19,35-50,first safari,Budget Safari Zanzibar,1,The pilot left us at the Selous Game Reserve,"We booked the safari through our hotel Fruit and Spice Wellness Resort. We arrived on time at the departure airport in Zanzibar for the one day safari to Selous. The airplane was to make several stops to drop off and pick up passengers before we got to Selous, but our expected arrival time was 8:55am. We took off and got to the first stop. Upon arrival we saw that the transportation for the first group being dropped off was not there. We were in the middle of nowhere and there was no cell reception. The pilot tried to contact someone but didn't have any luck. We waited 90 minutes in the heat for the transportation to arrive. Once they picked up the passengers we got back on the plane to make the rest of the stops. Due to this significant delay, we did not arrive at Selous until 11:45. This full day tour was now a half day tour since we had to be back by 4:15pm. 

Our guide was great and we got to see lots of animals. He did his best to make sure the trip was entertaining and that we weren't disappointed. In doing all of this, he did not get us back to the airstrip in enough time. We arrived just in time to see our airplane preparing for take off. The people at the reserve began to jump up and down to get the pilot's attention but he did not stop. At 4:45pm the pilot left and we were stranded at the game reserve.

After lots of calling around we were finally able to agree to have them take us to Dar Es Salaam. It is the closest city with an airport but it is also an 8 hour ride, with the first four hours spent on unpaved dark roads. We rode for four hours in a safari Jeep through primarily wooded areas. After four hours we arrived at a village and met up with another driver who took us to Dar Es Salaam, which was another 4 hours.

The tour company was very apologetic and arranged for this transportation. They also arranged for us to stay in a hotel across the street from the airport since we had an early flight back to Zanzibar. We needed to get back early because we were flying to Dubai and didn't want to miss our departure flight. Consequently, our Zanzibar hotel had to pack all of our things and check us in for our flight home.

The hotel in Dar Es Salaam was maybe 2 stars and served its purpose for the night. We were covered in dirt and bug bites from the first portion of our trip but the bathroom was not one you wanted to take a shower in and they only gave us one towel. We sat in the hotel room for 5 hours before it was time to leave for the airport. Luckily we made all of our flights, the hotel in Zanzibar did a wonderful job packing us up, and we showered and slept once we got to Dubai.

I was really looking forward to the safari. Being left there with no contingency plan by the tour company was completely unacceptable. I would not recommend this tour company under any circumstances. We were fortunate to make it out but there were so many things that could have gone wrong. Our driver for the day was super nice and the villagers that provided us with food and water and blankets for our 8 hour ride were lovely. "
Shannon,US,Visited: February 2016,11-May-16,35-50,over 5 safaris,Oakland Tours and Safaris,2,We did not get what we paid for,"On the 5, 6, 7 May, my two colleagues and I went on a ¢®¡Æclassic¢®¡¾ three-day, two-night Maasai Mara safari with Oakland Tours Kenya. 
 
It was critical that we booked a private safari as the three of us rarely, if ever, have the chance to meet in person.  
 
Felistus from Oakland confirmed that this would be the case.

We were also told that we would be staying at Fisi Camp, as per the information on the website. However, on Friday we were driven to Manyatta Camp. (Felistus told me after I telephoned her that this was an ¢®¡Æupgrade¢®¡¾, but I had made the booking purely on the fact that we were to stay at Fisi.)
 
On the Friday evening, as we were heading back to the camp after a game drive, our driver, Patrick (who is the saving grace in this whole debacle, because of his exemplary attitude) ran into some troubles with our vehicle, and we had to abandon the vehicle and catch a lift with another group back to camp. We were told that the vehicle would be fixed and ready for our game drive the next morning.
 
However, the next morning, the van was not fixed. Patrick told us that a part was being delivered from Nairobi which would be used to fix the car. He arranged that we joined another group (of 4 other people ? not a private safari). We did not even have the chance to sit together. 
 
At the end of the day (4pm), the part had not yet arrived from Nairobi, though by 7pm it had, and we were absolutely assured that we would have our private game drive the following morning, 
 
Again, we were disappointedthe car was not fixed and we joined another group (5 people) for the morning game drive. We were also told that we would be driven back to Nairobi that morning in a rather beaten-up saloon car.
 
When we arrived back in Nairobi, Felistus and her business partner were there to greet us and offer their apologies. We had told them that we sought financial compensation because we had paid for a service (in full) that was not delivered. The best they could offer us was local currency for a trip back to the airport. (Which we did not need, but took.)
 
We found Felistus' attitude to be not at all what we had read about onlineshe brazenly told us that she would not take responsibility for what had happened, and she proceeded to blame poor Patrick for any wrongdoings/bad decisions made on her part. She didn¢®?t seem in the least bit interested in the fact that we had paid for a private safari, but had not received one, telling us that they ¢®¡Ægot us to the Masaai Mara and back¢®¡¾ and that was the only responsibility that they had.
 
What¢®?s more, on our itinerary, it was listed that we would enjoy a trip to a local Masaai village on Sunday. This did not happen, and when we questioned Felistus on this point, she said it was ¢®¡Æoptional¢®¡¾ (but, clearly, not our option, as we were never given the choice)!
 
I had spent some time investigating the wealth of companies that run safaris in the Mara and budget camps. It¢®?s frustrating that nothing that I thought I had chosen was eventually delivered.

I understand that a safari is a complex product, and that things go wrong. But it's how you deal with it, Felistus and Oakland, that is of the utmost importance for continued business.

The one star is for the good guide that Travelust gave us for the first four days of our trip.  The guide was  very good but then abandoned our group in Bwindi when he left for a family emergency.  We lost thousands of dollars to Travelust and owner James Kateeba, had to ride in an unsafe, rusty vehicle with broken seats, windows and missing seat belts. Travelust took our money but never purchased our gorilla and monkey permits. In addition, we had to come up with cash to leave Murchinson National park  when  Travelust's Uganda Wildlife card had no funds on it. We also had to pay for a new guide and vehicle when our original guide left us at our  Bwindi hotel. Before our original guide abandoned us,  he  told us that he would not  be  able to take us over the border for  the Rwanda portion of our trip since our vehicle was unsafe and we had a police report filed for James Kateeba/Travelust when he  scammed us out of $6700 .  Fortunately the eight of us  on the safari are well traveled and made the best of a bad situation . Despite all the issues,  we enjoyed Uganda and Rwanda and gorilla and chimp trekking but please use a reputable tour operator and NOT Travelust. "
Shashank,US,Visited: August 2019,03-Aug-19,20-35,first safari,Right Choice Tours & Safaris,2,"Very good operator, extremely rude drivers","Masai Mara & Nakuru30 July 2019; for short version, look below. 

I am so conflicted giving this a 2 star rating because we (group of 9, with 7 visiting from the US) had a terrible experience largely due to one person (Julius - experienced but grumpy & rude tour guide who seems to hate his job/life), but the rest of everything else was great. However, Julius largely defined  the experience for the group that he was driving, so I unfortunately cannot justify more than 2 stars. All 9 of us are avid travelers and visit 3-4 countries every year (4 of us are above the age of 60), with 2 who live and work in Kenya, and there was consensus that these were among the most disrespectful people we¢®?ve met. 

We are a large group and worked with George for a few months, during which we made multiple changes and George was absolutely fantastic, accommodating, and patient throughout, designing a customized trip for us - I had decided I would give this operator a 5 star rating even before the trip, but then, enter Julius. Right from day 1, he seemed a bit rude and on edge with his responses to any question. Since we were in a mindset of trying to have fun, and had planned this for months, we ignored it and tried to brush it off. We had 2 vehicles, and the other tour guide, Milton, seemed much friendlier until Julius turned him by day 3, so we had him acting snippy towards the end too. After a few incidents it became hard to ignore Julius¢®? rudeness (example - at one point when we said it was uncomfortable to have a large empty ice box in the car, as the water he brought had run out anyway, he responded with ¢®?then you have to be uncomfortable¢®?; not even a hint of empathy, or trying to find a solution). Oh and he also whipped out a large machete that was under the seat on at least a few occasions (pretending to clean it) possibly with the aim of intimidating everyone, and I guess it worked. Imagine being in a jungle at the mercy of someone like that (he even looks scary). Both drivers started acting very dictatorial, telling us what the new plan was (different from the itinerary), and not offering any options, or entertaining any suggestions. We finally got a different driver on day 3 (James) who was absolutely fabulous - and told us more about Mara and wildlife in one hour on the freeway, than Julius did in 2 days, but unfortunately he was there only to drive us back home, so we didn¢®?t really get to do any Game drives with him. 

TLDRGeorge - amazing guy, very easy to work with; tour guide Julius ruined the experience with his blunt rudeness; The other guide Milton was okay first couple of days, but also became rather rude  after seeing Julius talk to the group with no respect and get away with it. James (who stood in for Julius on day 3 was absolutely fantastic, and well spoken, and the guide we all wished we had through the safari), so be super careful who you select as a tour guide/driver as it is critical in how your experience turns out.

shir,IL,Visited: October 2019,19-Nov-19,20-35,first safari,Lovely Safari,1,worst company ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"As we arrived, at the airport, we went to the car and the guide wanted us to pay the parking bill.
At the first day of the safari after about 30 min driving the manger called our guide and told him he need to pick up other clients from the airport ( our driver doesn't speak english!!!!!) And we had to insist he will stay.
At the end of the first safari day, there was a problem in the car (red charging light) but they kept driving. The guide didn't know where our accomodation was, and we got lost in the area. he missed the turn and got us into mud and the car got stuck. We had to walk in the rain, mud and in the dark for 20 minutes to the accomodation while
Our bags are in the car.
When we arrived we realized this was a solar accomodation (Sunrise) which has no warm water after 9pm. We were cold, upset and without any other clothing. 
We called the manager (tarimo) to ask for some warm water but he ignored us.
The guide finally came back and promised us that there will be hot water but there wasn't and he just went away.
The next morning was a big waste. We were told to be ready at 8am but they didnt fix the car at night and we had to wait for 6 hours!!!!!!!! 
6 hours was waste of time!waiting  for the guide
To solve the problems that he should have solved at night. He lied to us all the way. He said he would bring another car but of course it never happened. We lost a full safari day. 
Again, Tarimo was ignoring us and even hung up the calls from us.
When we faced the guide and asked him for the truth he was rude and ignored us the whole day. 
Also the car was slower than the other cars and every ride took much more time than the others .
Dont spend your money on this company!"

First, the person who contact me during my booking sent a full itinerary of our 7-day trip. According to the itinerary, our transport vehicle is 4x4 Landcruiser, which is written in large bold font in the email. However, they offered us a small ugly van during all 7 days. They changed our vehicle without any inform, so we are demoted to a lower van but not any refund. We paid for the 4x4 Landcruiser, but got a small van finally.
Second, our guide always showed dirty look at most time like that he was not pleasant with us. And during the tour, he provided little useful lesson or knowledge about the safari. We don't think he is a competent guide. Even there is a time when he set a departure time as 4pm, we arrived at the van at 4:03pm. He blamed me that we were not on time. He made us feel that he was not offering service but disciplining even that we gave him tips everyday. Once we changed the tip time from morning to the evening, he asked us in the afternoon that why no tip that day.
By the way, we lost our card reader and mosquito repellent in the car when we are at hotel.
To sum up, the experience during this safari trip is not as pleasant as we expect.
Next year when I take my family here, I will not choose this agency any more."
Simon,DE,Visited: July 2023,22-Aug-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Explorer Kenya Tours & Travel,2,Bad driver did not deliver tour itinerary.,"Maybe this experience is idiosyncratic, but our driver was not delivering the booked tour itinerary.

We booked a 3 days Amboseli safari, with a morning game drive on the last day.

The driver refused to deliver the morning game drive even though it was clearly on the itinerary. He also got aggressive ans insulting when we brought up the topic. My conjecture is that the driver wanted to pocket in the entrance fee for the park.

Further, on the way back, driver did not pay toll for expressway in Nairobi, letting us stand in traffic jam for 2 hours and unnecessarily prolonging the journey.

Also the convenience fee they charge on online payments is unreasonable.

Otherwise the service was okay but for the price I would expect differently.

Stay away from this provider."
Simon,CA,Visited: June 2018,30-Jul-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Selous Ngalawa Camp,1,Beautiful Mikumi and Udzungwa spot but choose  another operator,"We highly recommend to go to Mikumi and Udzungwa, but not with these folks.

Here is an excerpt of what we sent to the tour operator:

""
Our guide was great and both parks are stunning, however we are mostly disappointed by the trip. 

First of all, the way to Mikumi was 8 hours. We could see on the map that it was not close but we expected 4-5 hours top to get to an activity. It was instead 8-9 hours both ways, which on a 3 days Safari is a lot of time spent travelling. Knowing that beforehand would have greatly impacted our decision to do this trip. 
This also meant that we arrived late to Mikumi national park and did only about 2 hours of game drive, but still had to pay the 82.60 USD entrance fee, which we paid again on the second day. 
At the end of that first day, the lodge was comfortable but we had no running water for the sink, shower and toilet. 

On the second day, the last minute change to stay in Mikumi and not do the planned hike to a waterfall meant that we did a game drive for the entire day, this was really disappointing since we chose this Safari for the hikes and activities on foot, but after two days we only sat in the Jeep, which again would have make us greatly reconsider taking this trip in the first place. Now another important point is the fact that the park was being torched to leave soil for the new grass. Because of this, the park was somewhat empty due to animals running away from the fires. This is a yearly event which we did not know would happen as outsiders, but we would have expected you to warn us when we did the booking at that time. Especially since we were spending much more time in Mikumi. So for the second day we rolled in circles for hours looking at the same few antelopes and zebras. It got to such a point that at around 4pm we simply told the guide to go to the hotel. We would have done it much earlier but we wanted to be respectful of our guide who tried so hard to find something interesting. 

On the third day, we finally got out of the car to do a hike, but looking at all the available hikes in the beautiful Udzungwa (94.40USD) we felt like we missed a great opportunity to hike more. That last day finished late, at around 9pm we were dropped at Dar but we did not have any diner along the way, leaving us to wander in Dar after dark for food. 

As for the money, we were also disappointed that you did not told us before that the park fees were to be paid by credit card. We withdraw a lot of extra chillings which we did not use in our remaining days in Tanzania and which we cannot convert in Canada. Around 200,000 unused chillings which were withdraw with a 15,000 fee, and then converted in USD at the airport again at a large fee. Also, the entrance fees were supposed to be around 80 USD per day, but the last lark ended up being a total of 259.60 USD (not 240 USD)

Finally, there were a few other points in the description of the tour, such as a visit to the Masaii and a python in one of the Mikumi lake, which apparently did not exist according to our guide. We choose your tour among other reasons for that and did not visit the Madrid village.

Overall, the guide and parks were great, but the whole management of the tour is simply sub-par. 
""

From there we would have written a 2-3 stars above, but the response of the operator was aggressive and accusing us of lying, which is pathetic since all of the promises were clearly written in an email, so we had proofs.

The last email we received mostly stated that since the tour was a budget one, it was okay to offer the minimum and cut on what they deemed unnecessary. So if you don't like being played with, I recommend choosing another operator. "

Simon - UK,US,Visited: January 2016,08-Jun-16,50-65,over 5 safaris,Sunrise Eco-Tours,1,A Terrible Experience ... Sunrise Eco-Tours,"We booked and paid for a bespoke Ugandan Safari with Sunrise Eco-Tours scheduled to depart in February 2016. Initially communication with the company was good but as the departure date approached it became very difficult to contact company representatives. 

In January 2016 we were advised by a third party that Sunrise Eco-Tours was experiencing ""operational difficulties"" and social media reports started to appear stating how clients already on tours organised by the company were being asked to pay again for activities, such as gorilla trekking, as well as hotel bills that they had already paid for.

At this point, just weeks before our tour was to commence, communication with Sunrise Eco-Tours became extremely difficult and the company owner, Clement Kanamuguire, when telephoned just terminated the call or stated that he was busy and could not respond to any questions.

We then took it upon ourselves to call the respective hotels, lodges and guest houses in Uganda that we were supposed to be staying at only to discover that there were no reservations for us. We had been emailed previously by Sunrise Eco-Tours to confirm that all our accommodation had been booked. At this point we asked the company for documentation to show that our gorilla trekking permits and our chimpanzee trekking permits had been booked and confirmed. We also asked for an explanation as to why we had been lied to regarding our accommodation bookings. Unfortunately Sunrise Eco-Tours refused to communicate with us and did not provide documentation or explanations. 

It was at this point we asked Sunrise Eco-Tours for a full refund of all monies, many thousands of pounds, paid to them as their ""operational difficulties"" had lead to a breach of contract. They were unable to provide the safari we had paid for. 

When it became clear that Sunrise Eco-Tours had no intention of honouring the contract and providing the safari our travel agent, Responsible Travel, identified another company who agreed to create a similar safari for us with only two weeks to go before we were scheduled to depart for Uganda. Sandfield Travel ""pulled out all the stops"" and managed to arrange transport and guides, book hotels as well as obtain the necessary trekking permits prior to our departure. Communication with them was excellent and the subsequent safari exceeded our expectations   

We cannot speak to highly of Rosy at Responsible Travel and Wycliffe at Sandfield Travel ... and would recommend you speak to them rather than engage with Sunrise Eco-Tours.

To date there has been no further communication from Sunrise Eco-Tours in spite of numerous emails and  telephone calls. There has been no refund of the any monies paid to them. Caveat emptor!! We certainly learnt a very expensive lesson.

Communication before departure (we booked the safari online, before arriving to Tanzania) was very good: Masha promptly replied to all our (several) questions, although during the safari we discovered that some points were not so accurate (e.g. I asked information about electricity in the camps, and I was told that it was available in all them; but in 2 places there was no way to charge batteries and mobile phones.. I think this information is important and should be mentioned before). We enjoyed our gamedrives, although we were quite disappointed by their duration.. by reading the program you cannot really perceive how much time you will spend in the camps, especially for breakfast/dinner breaks.. many times, we noticed that we were the last to leave in the morning and the firsts to come back to the camp (also, one morning we asked our guide to leave 30min before - NB. everyone else left at 6.30-7.. we were told that we had to be ready"
SkiNHGolfer. See Full Alert in Trip Advisor.,US,Visited: December 2017,06-Jan-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Adventure Dragon Safaris,1,Scam Alert. Francis Otieno (Holgger) is a 1 person tour company with a fake website. He scammed me!,"We just concluded a wonderful 7 days in Kenya. Its a beautiful country with amazing wild life - but I want to raise a scam alert in case you run into the same tour operator/rental agency. We chose to rent a 4x4 with driver in Nairobi to have a 6 day Safari to the Masaai Mara and Naivasha before returning to Nairobi and flying back to the USA. I worked via email and phone to book a Toyoto Land Cruiser from a guy named Francis Otieno (Holgger) from ""Adventure Dragon Safaris"". I later find out that ""Holgger"" (a 1 employee owner) also shows up in Trip Advisor as @holggeropondo faking to be a traveler!

But I took a look at the website below, and since there were no alerts I went ahead with the booking.

Here's what happened:

- Francis (Holgger) was proactive and (overly) friendly via email and whatsapp phone convincing me he was legitimate.

- He requested a 25% advance payment for the rental of a 4x4 on booking via PayPal (that I paid)

- When I landed in Nairobi, at the time of getting the 4x4 he revised his price and requested an extra day of payment AND also requested a $150 ""insurance deposit"" that he said he will pay me back on return of 4x4

- Being in a new country, I trusted him and paid up BOTH incremental $ requests.

When I finished the Safari, he conned me from paying back the $150 deposit. (He kept telling me that he had initiated deposit return via Pay Pal, but he was lying). He also lied about the 4x4 being a newer vehicle with AC. Infact, I later find out he doesnt even own any of the vehicles on his web site - that he rents the car and driver from a different company/3rd parties, fronting himself via a fake website.

Please BE AWARE.

I have benefitted so much from Trip Advisor that I feel obligated to inform my fellow travelers so you can be carful. Like I said, 99.9% of Kenyan are GREAT people - and I tried not to let this one bad seed spoil my wonderful vacation! I am also reaching out to the Kenyan travel association authorities to let them know so they can take appropriate action again Adventure Dragon Safaris and Francis Otieno (Holgger).

Good luck and Happy Safari'ing!"

Firstly, our poorly maintained and serviced vehicle broke down on New Year's day, and the company blamed us for a series of damages which of course were not created by us.
Then, the next day, they sent another vehicle with a driver to continue our journey in Uganda because they could not trust us. So on 2nd of January 2019, the driver, during an overtake, crashed the car into oncoming vehicle from the other side.
Not only the company did not apologize or provided another option (to leave the accident spot or to be moved elsewhere), but the only communication we received is an email with the costs of the alleged damages. They never reimbursed us for the daily rentals for the days that we did not have the car, and they also charged us for filling up two fuel tanks, while the delivered two car fuel empty.
I am really sorry to say that you should not trust Prime Uganda Safari as the whole altitude was completely inappropriate and unprofessional, let alone that they put our lives at risk twice without taking any responsibility.

I booked a 2-day safari but it was just one day. We were picked up at 6.00 in the morning. It was said the trip would be 4-5 hours but took more than 7. Due to the car breaking down we didnt get to eat breakfast until 10.00. Then 2 hours later they said we should have lunch. That was to soon so we ended up eating at a ¢®¡¾restaurant¢®¡¾ in the park. The food here was not good.
The drive in the park in the afternoon was great and we saw all the animals we wanted. Our guide Tony was very good.
We were driven to the acommodations TanSwiss around 18.30. The stay here was ok but when we asked our guide about day-2-plans he said we were just going home. No more safari.
In the booking i was promised ¢®¡¾After breakfast from lodge with the packed lunches enjoy en route game drive in Mikumi National Park before depart to Dar es Salaam in which you will arrive in evening¢®¡¾. This booking promises a second day and writng about lunch like that gives you the impression that it will last a couple of hours.
In the morning the guide made it feel like were going for a drive around the outskirts of the park and would see many animals.
One hour after leaving the hotell were out of the park and on our way home. Super short en route game drive with no packed lunches, just one hour on the big road.

The titel of this trip should not be ¢®¡¾best 2-day Mikumi safari¢®¡¾ instead ¢®¡¾4 hour safari with lodge stay¢®¡¾

I am sure that there are other companies that offer safari with better service and that can deliver what they promised. So I would not recommend LuiTours."

We communicated through WhatsApp and paid 30% cost in advance. Once we reached Nairobi, we paid remaining amount a day before. We specifically booked 4x4 Land cruiser option and paid for the same. But on a day of safari they gave us van. The driver had no idea so we called tour manager, Lilian. She refused to change the vehicle. She insisted on meeting and she came two hours late to meet us on the day of the safari. Later she admitted it is her mistake but she won't change vehicle without additional payment. We argued but she said she quoted wrong price. It seemed she deliberately came late so that we give in and pay additional cost as we did not want to waste time. It was already late to start the safari. We kept calling her, texting her and beg her to come earlier. We had to pay $350 additional cost as we did not want to compromise on our experience and then she changed our vehicle. Again the Land cruiser given to us was in very bad condition. It was old, seats were broken and no cooler for water. 

This did not stop there. They changed our accomodation without informing or discussing with us. We were promised a different lodge in Lake Naivasha but was given a downgrade. When we tried to talk to them about it, they just kept telling it is not downgrade where we can clearly use google and see it is a downgrade. They would directly inform the driver where to take us for the stay without dropping a single messege to us about the change. 

This company is run by very unprofessional group of people who are liars and scammer. Do not book with them. They will ruin your once in a life experience of safari with their mismanagement."
Sol,KE,Visited: March 2018,29-Mar-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Vivid Adventure Safaris Ltd,1,Non-trustworthy,"Uganda was impressive country. However, this was the worst safari experience I have ever had.
If someone really needs to contact this agency, please make sure to read the followings;
1) The proposal you receive via e-mail is different from what you need to pay when you get out of airport. 
They intentionally give you low-cost quote and change their word saying it was a 'mistake' which they've been repeating many times already. 
Please make sure to bring extra cash to pay when asked for. 
Otherwise, you need to look for ATM which is not easily working in the country. 
Also, you will need to undergo unpleasant argument throughout the journey until you pay the extra money.
2) This agency is appropriate for those who do not travel alone - especially not for a single lady.
When you are traveling by yourself, then you will encounter a blackmail in the middle of trip that the tour guide will drop you off there and leave in the middle of nowhere.
3) You will understand what is typical African-style lie, telling whatever they want to convince you to pay more. Didn't want to argue about details, but it was disgusting to listen to throughout the journey."
Sonia,FR,Visited: October 2018,27-Oct-18,20-35,first safari,Bobby Tours Tanzania Safaris,1,"If you can avoid this company, do it - it will be better for your Tanzanian experience","We booked a safari for 3 nights and 4 days in October 2018. The tent they provided had holes all over and water came inside when it rained. Poor equipement for everything. Food was great though.

To sum up our experience (with the management, not the drivers), if everything is ok then alright, if a problem occurs then it's your loss. 

We had a faboulous driver, he showed us many wonderful things, and always went the extra mile to show us what we wanted and caring for us when one of us was sick. 

But the management of the company and mainly from the manager : Kassim Abdallah, was one of the worst management I ever seen. The company gave our driven a broken car, that stopped several times during our trip. Every time, our driver tried to fix it (and sometimes paying with his own money!). But what was supposed to happen, happened eventually. On our evening in the Serengeti, the car broke completely. We had to push the car to make it start again, which worked at first, but then it stopped again and for good. So we waited in the car for half a day, in the middle of the wildlife, while our driver was left alone by the company to find a solution for us. Our driver finally found a fellow driver that was able to bring us to our camp for the last night but we never saw our driver again. 

We requested the same driver for our last day but they sent another one anyway. What was worse is that the manager, Kassim, did not event try to get in touch with us to keep us updated and to ask us if the arrangments made were ok for us. We were left waiting, not knowing what would happen since our cook did not have any news, and did not speak english enough to explain even if he knew. On our last day, we asked the new driver to take us to the office to speak with the manager but when the new driver called him, we overheard him ordering not to bring us to the office and ""offer"" our ride back to the airport. 

Client service = 0. If I could go back, I would have paid more instead of saving money and be treated as badly as Bobby Tours treated us. "
Sophia,UK,Visited: January 2014,22-Nov-16,20-35,first safari,It Started in Africa,1,"The good, the bad and the very ugly parts of It Started In Africa","I experienced a the good, the bad and the ugly parts of this company, It Started in Africa.
I was a solo female traveller and safety was a priority.  I knew I could have paid less with other companies, but the BBC Travel logo really did stand out to me.  A company with BBC Travel as a partner would surely have set standards and uphold a duty of care to it's travellers.
Let me start off with the good. I was partnered with Martin who was an experienced safari guide and he was such a kind and caring guide.  We chatted and he would educate me on all aspects of the country, the landscape, the trees/plants and all the details of the animals. He also helped me learn all the names of the animals in Swahili and I was very grateful to have him as a guide. 
The company who mans the emails responded promptly to emails and the trip was arranged and paid for within a week of my initial email query.
The BAD:
The night before departure from home to Tanzania, I received an email to inform me of a mis-booking at Ngorongoro Crater. My option was to go to another campsite (not their first line recommended) or upgrade to their recommended. It was quite stressful to think that I had to pay another further amount and my tour hadn¢®?t even started. I paid it but really thought the company should have covered the full cost as it was booked 1 month in advanced and the night before flying out I had to respond and ensure it was booked. The company advised that it was the accomodation¢®?s fault, but really, it should have been picked up on confirmation not reconcilliation, days prior to my tour.
My other bad part was on my 2nd last day in Arusha where I was no longer on safari with Martin and planned and paid $125USD for a coffee plantation tour. The company sent me off with a Driver and a guide named James. James kept questioning why I want to go on the coffee plantation tour and tried to persuade me to go to a Tanzanite tour (it was obvious he wanted to commission for tanzanite purchase). He was quite persistent & I had to be firm and say it was a coffee tour he was to take me to. He kept pushing me so I agreed with enough time after the coffee plantation tour I would go.
Instead of taking me to the half day plantation tour (included lunch at the plantation) that was 1+ hr away from Arusha (Moshi - tripadvisor has it rated well) he tried to do a dodgy self tour by the side of a road of a coffee farm. Understanding the tour (from other people I met along the way) and that a 30minute drive in traffic was not Moshi, I spoke up. James then proceeded to say I had to pay for that tour. I told him I have! They then drove me to this town at the foots of Mt Meru to a plantation, stopping and asking for directions along the road (this was not the one I was to visit) and I was asked to pay $51USD. After saying (again) I had paid, and knowing this is not the right place, I thought I was stuck in the middle of nowhere, feeling a unsafe and on my own with 2 men the company sent me off with who clearly have not taken me to the correct place, I will be quiet and go along with it. But after it clearly was not what I paid for, I asked to speak to Mathias (Manager of Arusha office). James kept ignoring my many pleas. After another 15 minutes, I got really mad and demanded it and refused to walk any further and pretty much had to raise my voice and have a meltdown-like tantrum until he eventually did. I spoke to Mathias and said I was not taken where I was suppose to be, it was 3pm, I have lost a day and would like to return to the office for a refund then back to my hotel. I told him I do not feel safe here - during this tour, a group of school children followed behind me stealing my water bottle which I happily said was fine, but they went to unzip my backpack and grabbed my hand and asked me for my watch as well. My guide James was walking 5-10m ahead intently listening and learning from the other tour guide. James continued to avoid taking me back to the office for a refund and insisted I continue the tour. I was stuck and just agreed to get it over and go back to the safety of my hotel. During the tour, James took photos of me on his phone. I was not happy about the whole unsafe situation I was in. I was walking with 2 men into farming land away from other people on a tour I did not feel was real. Luckily, the tour finished off, and they asked me to tip the guide. I refused as it was not the tour I paid for. On the drive back, James thought it was amusing to take more photos of me in the car - I was furious! I asked him to delete all photos of me and he tried to just delete 1. I was stern and said all. Whether he did or not, I do not know.
Eventually they returned me to my hotel (refused to take me to the office for a refund) & told me Mathias the manager, would meet me at the hotel. Mathias avoided me. My hotel manager overheard my terrible experience that evening (3 hours after my return) and contacted the company to ensure someone came down to chat to me. Without the hotel manager's persistence, I doubt anyone would have met me to apologise. A large, unfriendly, and unkept man arrived to the hotel and after explaining the events, he did not offer an apology. In fact I felt he was sent to intimidate me into submission. I stood my ground and he eventually got on the phone and let me speak to Bernard the Tanzania Manager for It Started In Africa. I had to explain the days events again, and I was quite fed up at this point so I told him that he needed to do the right thing and refund the money. I said I know he can refuse, but if his company was truly apologetic in sending me off with 2 men who cheated me of a tour I paid for, he would organise a refund. Eventually, Bernard assured me that they would refund me and that the following day Mathias would have the money in cash for me at the hotel for my airport transfer.
The ugly...
the following day, they made my guide Martin return to Arusha (from his home town 1 hr south of Arusha) to smooth it over. When I still wanted my refund they handed me 1/3 of the value. Another man was there also (to intimidate me?). They arrived 20mins late for my airport transfer and had to remind them the amount owed. Martin wrote it down and got on the phone to Mathias. After a drive to the office, Mathias finally met me. He handed another 1/3 of the value. I was still short! He made excuses that he wasn't told the amount. I knew my guide Martin called him up and said in Swahili the exact number (i learnt the swahili numbers). I confronted Mathias who did not expect me to know the Swahili numbers. Mathias returned with the rest of the money and then made an excuse that the person who organised the refund did it wrong - Mathias is the office manager! Who else would organise it? Another terrible lie!! 1 hour behind schedule we headed to the airport. Along the way, the other man in the car spoke in Swahili to Martin and laughed about me - I referred to the the guide and driver that day as cowboys, and this man repeated it and laughed. I did not find this professional sitting next to him while he made fun of me and gave me intimidating stares. My guide Martin did not respond, being the professional he was and knowing that I understand a few words of Swahili.
Later, I found my itinerary with the full amount breakdown and circled the value to be refunded in the car! They knew the amount to be refunded and hoped to get away with less. It was very upsetting that I had to deal with 5 different men who attempted to intimidate me and waste time to avoid a refund!
I was left in tears from the emotional experience.
It was truly a corrupt Arusha Office!
I arrived at the airport late and just made my flight - my luggage was not able to make the flight.
On return I wrote an email to the Europe base and they were not even informed of this incident and mishandling afterwards. Joao in customer relations did well in responding with an apology & a promise of a full investigation. I asked to see the report and was told this can take long to prepare. I really hope they investigate and learn from this incident and mishandling but I am not to know if they will actually follow this up. I acknowledge that a full refund was given for the extra night accomodation and day tour that I was cheated out of, and they refunded the extra amount I had to pay for the last minute change in accomodation. 
Tanzania was a beautiful country and I would definitely love to return. But would I chose to go on tour with It Started In Africa? Definitely not!
I have written this review so that anyone who does go on tour with It Started In Africa - be careful!! Make sure you are aware of what you paid for and if you are cheated of any experience or tours you paid for, you get the refund!
If you are thinking twice about this company - do some further research! While on tour I came across the most popular Leopard tours, trek2kili, Abercrombie & kent etc
But if you chose to try It Started In Africa - do your research & be self aware!!"

I was in tears fighting them 2 hrs before my airport transfer and ended up arriving to the airport w 30mins to go. 
From my Tripadvisor review i was contacted by numerous people who were swindled their deposit. The company went down, changed names then restarted again under it started in africa. 
After my review they offered me monetary compensation to take my review down. I refused. Then coincidentally my tripadvor account kept sending me emails that i wanted to reset the password. Im not accusing anyone of hacking but it was interesting times.
I was emailed by Bernard to review my trip again so they could use it for other travellers. Hope this finds everyone well as a clear warning! I do not advise putting any deposit into this company. Other tours exist so research well and contact the reviewers"

But, instead, we had to stay in budget lodge (We paid 4720 USD per person). When we told him we were angry, he did nothing. During all the safari, he didn't respect his contract, he never informs us in advance of change. If he was correct, if an hotel is full, he could inform us and propose us another choice, with eventually another price. We saw Kapolondo himself at the beginning of the tour and he did'nt inform us of the change, even for the first night. He is coward. He made on our back about 100 to 500 USD by night for 4 nights he made a change.
Worst the car wasn't safe, a wire caught fire, we had to stop in emergency but there was not hand brake, we had to run to stop the car with a stone and to put out the fire. We travelled with a 9-month baby...
At the end of the trip, we asked him for an amical settlement. He accepted it and asked us to send an email. we did it, but he never answers.
He didn't organise our trip, the guide didn't know the program. We had to wait 2 hours before entering Segerenti park (while the other cars waiting 30 minutes) because he didn't book the hotel the day before. We did not visit some part of the program.
He didn't inform us that we have 5% visa charge before we paid. But, it's a legal obligation, he must inform the customer before the payment! He didn¢®?t inform us that we have to paid for the luggage for each internal flight, about 100 USD more for the 3 flights.
We will file a complaint against him in court."

I have spent $645 per head for 2 of us for a private tour instead of direct booking through the hotels website which would cost me $404/person for the same tour. I want a peaceful safari during the year end and change of career as per my choice Beavis of photography  and what I got  
1. The open Car - the car they provided as per my request,  doesn't have the permit to enter in national park and stopped by the official today morning. 
2. The 2nd car, which take us from Dar es salaam to Salous and back had different problem, once that car stopped you need some help to push the car to start, it's almost a 40 years old car, I feel pity for the driver Mike who is a nice person and good driver and always try to help with a smile. 
3. I would like to take a name knowingly it's the great Joshua(owner of the Gombe tours company) the great story teller and full of  commitments which never be fulfilled and he will definitely will never talk to you once you started complaining about anything during your tour instead one of his so called agent(Yusuf) will speak to you and always try to prove that everything is your luck and fault and they are the best. 

 For your information I back to Dar es Salaam after 2 nights without spending the 3rd night there because I can't tolerate such nonsense service anymore. What a bad start of new year. 

I don't recommend this guys as I feel I got cheated and not be treated well after paying full amount on the first day. 

It's better to book hotel directly and book car from hotel for your safari, so that you can pay at hotel and there will be someone in person present to listen your complain if any.  This middleman short terms  traders are the problem in Tanzania. Most of them doesn't have their own car, doesn't have their own guide they just have ample time to  response on your first query to make you fool and then they take good amount and pay for worst service to serve you, they will ensure 3rd graded rooms in a hotel, old hired car without any maintenance or paper sometime and you never saw them in person. 
However I have visited, Tarangire,  Manyara, Ngorongoro, Ndutu, North Serengeti, Zanzibar, Mikumi during last one year with few other renowned travel agencies who are really good and professional., Shadow of Africa, Amo Zanzibar tour and safari, African quinsang adventure safari are few of them where I got full value for money.

At the beginning she was answering quickly to my questions so I decided to book and pay the amount she told me. Once I paid I had to wait since 31st May to 29th June to have my confirmation. I had to send several emails (without answer) and that was feeling like a scam. After that, I had to write her a few days before to make sure everything was fine and that was when she told me the planning had changed ¢®¡Æbecause the government increased the price of the entrance fee¢®¡¾, so we had 1 day of 5 without visit to any park. Even that happened and I was informed two days before arrival, the price stayed the same. When we arrived there hopefully we met the best driver ever, Ken, who was working for another company and took care of us with all his love.

stayawayfromthisoperator,SG,Visited: July 2023,16-Aug-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Africa Joy Tours,1,"the worst operator ever, irresponsible and never solve the issues, only want to earn Chinese money","After a 30-hour flight, we discovered that our hotel rooms were not booked. I want to make it clear from the start that I don't want private messages asking for post deletion, nor do I need money to delete posts. I'm not lacking money.

We've just finished a 2-week trip to East Africa, where the natural beauty and adorable animals were stunning. However, the local tour agency, Africa Joy Tours, was a disappointment, greatly diminishing our experience.

In February of this year, our group of 8 people booked a customized 10-day trip to Kenya and Tanzania through Africa Joy Tours, starting in mid-July. We finalized the itinerary and paid the deposit in March. Subsequently, the agency's responses became increasingly slow, but due to numerous positive reviews on platforms like Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book), we attributed it to the laid-back African style and didn't raise concerns.

The first issue arose when, just before departure, we were informed that three of the hotels we were supposed to stay at had no available rooms (we needed 4 rooms for 8 people). Despite having paid the deposit in March, the hotels were not confirmed before our departure. Moreover, some of the replacement hotels were virtually unknown, and we couldn't find much information about them on various platforms, leading to concerns about our accommodation experience.

The second issue was with the unreliable drivers. Our first interaction with the tour agency was when we were picked up from Nairobi to head to Masai Mara. As per our agreement, the driver was supposed to pick us up at 6 am. However, one driver arrived an hour late, and we had to wait in the cold hotel lobby for him. During the journey, this driver stopped for coffee, making us wait for more than 30 minutes while he indulged himself. He also had a heated phone argument with the tour agency's owner while on the road. The journey that was supposed to take 5 hours ended up taking 8 hours. Both drivers seemed completely lost throughout the trip, not knowing where to go or what to do, relying on us to recognize our own group members. They repeatedly asked us what our next steps were, which was frustrating since we expected them to lead as paid guides. They even had us get off the vehicle to arrange our own lunch instead of taking us to the contracted hotel as planned.

The third and most significant issueafter an 8-hour journey, we arrived at our Masai Mara hotel at around 2 pm, only to find out that our rooms were not available. We were tired, hungry, and frustrated. We contacted the tour agency repeatedly, but they were slow to respond and kept telling us to wait while they were supposedly confirming. Eventually, they informed us that they had booked the rooms for the same dates in August, effectively leaving us without accommodation for that day and the next. We were left in disbelief and shock. We couldn't even have lunch at the hotel because we didn't have a confirmation. After a lengthy ordeal, three of us shared a room that night, and the agency arranged alternative accommodation for the next day. We kept requesting confirmation for the remaining hotels, but the agency was unresponsive and lacked an apologetic attitude. We managed to squeeze through the first night.

The fourth issuethe replacement hotel didn't have our reservation either. The next day, we were told that two rooms were arranged in a nearby hotel, which turned out to be over 30 kilometers away, taking over an hour to reach. After our game drive, we rushed to the new hotel, only to find out that our rooms were once again not booked. Despite our repeated requests for hotel confirmation documents, the agency never provided them. Two consecutive days of such problems left us infuriated, prompting us to threaten with negative reviews online. Suddenly, the agency's representative, Thompson, became more attentive, and communication improved, with promises of actively resolving the issues. After much back and forth, we learned that the hotels were not booked under the agency's name (which they failed to communicate), making it difficult for us to verify our reservations. After prolonged discussions, they finally managed to sort out our check-in. The agency finally apologized and mentioned considering a refund for the first day's accommodation that we couldn't use. I firmly insisted that they must refund rather than just considering it. We agreed to meet in person in Arusha to discuss further.

The fifth issuepushing for a refund for the unused hotel room and an additional $100 as compensation. In total, the refund amounted to $480 for our group of 8 people, translating to $60 per person (out of a total tour cost of $3400 per person). As agreed, the refund was supposed to be provided in cash on a specific day. However, Thompson, the agency's representative, disappeared and didn't show up. We repeatedly tried to contact him, but he never responded. We then had to contact Clinton, the agency's owner. He claimed they didn't have enough cash for the refund and hadn't prepared it yet. This was unacceptable since they had promised to provide the refund on that particular day. Their attitude towards resolving the issue was disheartening. We had to press Clinton to come and provide a partial refund in the evening, and he promised to complete the rest the next day. He was supposed to arrive at 10 am the next day but ended up arriving close to 12 pm. With this, our ordeal with Africa Joy Tours finally concluded. As an additional note, the agency initially claimed that lunch on the final day was included, but the hotel demanded $25 per person. We had to contact Clinton again to resolve this issue before we could have the lunch that should have been provided for free.

All the above incidents are documented through chat records. This is not an attempt to defame the tour agency. One peculiar aspect of Africa Joy Tours is their eagerness to attract Chinese tourists and promote their services, even repeatedly asking us to help them with promotion. Are we being treated as naive tourists, especially considering the experience we had? Not to mention the instances of sexual harassment by a driver in Tanzania who consistently made inappropriate comments and even shared his home address with female members of our group.

If the agency wishes to profit from Chinese tourists, they must enhance their services and improve their attitude. East Africa is stunning, but the tour agency's poor service greatly detracted from our experience. We spent days on end dealing with communication issues and disappointment, resulting in frustration and discontent."

Stefan,FR,Visited: November 2017,20-Dec-17,20-35,first safari,Trip Advisor Africa Safaris,1,Changed itinerary in the morning of the tour.,"We booked a 4 day safari with two nights in Seronera, Serengeti. They changed the itinerary in the morning when the safari started. We ended up having 1 night in Seronera and therefore no full day in the Serengeti. This way it is cheaper for them as we spent the first night outside the parks, that is why they did it. Given this change we wanted a discount of around 100$. They said we can have 20$ discount and if we do not accept we can have all the money back and leave. That was in the morning when the safari should have started. They could well have informed us the evening before when we paid, but they did not. As the choice was between no safari and changed itinerary we decided to join. The car was the oldest moving thing you can imagine and broke down in the middle of the savanna. They did not have tools with them to repair it. They did not have walkie talkies to call somebody for help. They did not have a rope in the car to tow away the car by another bypassing car. Imagine you get stuck in a water hole? In the end they repaired the car with the leather-man of another tourist who was in a car which stopped to help us. We ended up missing the last hour of our late evening safari because we had to bring other passengers to their camp. As we were very lucky we ended up seeing all the animals the next morning, but that was really pure luck. The parks are great and the guide was very friendly and did his best given the means he was given by the company. Again this was pure luck, all the other guides of the same company seamed not very competent. Food was ok. The overall organization done by the company was horrible. We booked with Trip Advisor Africa Safari, but basically this internet companies are selling their costumers to a Tanzanian operator. Ours operator was Sandland tours of Abraham Shaidi. The itinerary change was apparently the fold of Trip Advisor Africa Safari and its owner Seth Vincent. The bad equipment of the car is the fold of Shaidi. So even if you book with other companies ask for the operator and check its reviews. "
Steffen,DE,Visited: August 2019,16-Aug-19,20-35,first safari,Orongai Africa Safari,2,Not recommendable. Don't go with them.,"We had two safaris with them. Actually one is still running. The first was in Tansania. Besides humiliating toilets on campsites the tour was ok. Our driver Fred is really the best. Very nice, professional and funny. Our chef Abu is awesome aswell. Very humble friendly and a great chef. In total I think the price for a low budget safari (210$ per day p.P.) is to much. Besides they don't have so good jeeps. We had an accident and I scratched my head kind of badly. They didn't have a first aid kit, so I took some napkins to calm down the blood from my forehead. 

Our second safari was/is a mess. Our first day was an eleven hour bus trip from Mombasa to Nairobi. We wanted to start our trip from Mombassa because the Zawo East is just around the corner. But no chance. The woman who managed everything (Ann) said it would only be  a four hours drive... that was obviously a lie because it took us eleven. So no safari the first day. Of course we paid for the whole day including the food we didn't get. The accommodations are a mess aswell. No warm water, almost no wifi and the food is really bad. The last day of our trip is again just a 5 hours trip from Amboselli to Nairobi, so no safari again. 

All in all, do yourself a favour and book with some other organisation. "
Stelios,UK,Visited: November 2018,27-Nov-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Bobby Tours Tanzania Safaris,2,Appalling service,"4 Day budget camping safari. Ok I must say our desire to visit Ngorongoro has been fulfilled, We have seen the big 5. But not thanks to Bobby tours, Its a magical place and getting there is all you need.

We are hardcore backpackers and not fuzzy at all. We have traveled around Africa quite extensively using some really bad and uncomfortable buses.

Our safari trip was actually kind of treat as we were not relying on Public transport. 

The car came to pick us up from our lodge in Arusha, First impression is that the car was quite old which again it was ok with us as It was a treat compare to what we had before. But so we thought!

First game drive and everything was fine, lots of Elephants at Lake Manyara NP. 

We were told that we will visit a Masai Village inside Ngorongoro Area and will cost us 20USD when we booked the tour. Our driver claiming that we were short on time suggested we should visit a Masai Village near lake Manyara NP which was also near our first camp site. We agreed to do that but we were asked to pay 50USD instead which seemed that it was including a commission to whoever was taking us there and we were not impressed by the village at all as it seemed like a tourist trap. By that time we gave all of our cash we had on us as who needs cash in the bush anyway.

The camping site was in a nice forest area. However the tent we were given had a broken zip and lots of holes. It could not close properly but again as naive were we did not mind much. The camping site was fenced and other than few harmless monkeys they were no big animals around.

The second day we proceeded to Serengeti National park. A long dirt track driving! Here I realise how bad idea was to ride an old worn car. Dust was unbearable. There was no escape from it as it was simply coming inside the car because the roof could not seal properly. I discovered that the plastic that seals the roof was worn and almost totally gone. There was simply no way to keep the dust out. We had to endure hours of driving  with hazardous dust which basically went everywhere on our clothes, cameras, phones  you name it. 

When we arrived at our Serengeti Camp we found out from other people on similar tours with us from other companies that they simply closed the windows and had no dust at all. 

The night was really scary. Our faulty tent could easily let a Hyena to get inside our tent as the Camp was not fenced and wild animals where actually freely roaming around our tent. 

After we finished with Serengeti and on our final night after a filthy dusty day again the tent was useless against cold weather as our last camp was high up on the Crater Rim of Ngorongoro. 

ThereThereThe last day just before were dropped back to our lodge we had to drop our Chef first who was making our meals through the tour. We were asked to give some tips and we kindly gave him around 3-4USD as much as we had on us as were in the bush for few days. Our driver went furious saying that the guy was crying because he went home with out making any money as he was relying on tips and we should give him a minimum of 10USD which was what you must give to the Chef. The same story followed when were dropped back tour our lodge, the same story for the stupid tourists and that we must give 20USD of tips to the driver. We had paid our tour in full well in Advance and a Price tag on tips made us to feel really stupid. 

We found out later from some other local guides there that they are actually getting a decent salary for African Standards and they should never asked us that question. 

After we came back home I send an email explaining the situation to their office but they never got back to us"

Part 1. The manager, I think Ibrahim, took us from airport and went to a restaurant, it wa OK. 

Part 2 We went to the hotel which had no hot water... Whatever we were going in Safari next morning, he told us that the car will arrive at 8am. It arrived at 8.20 with the problem of windshields. We lost like anotjer 30 mins.

P4 The driver was ok and had the knowledge of the parks (Tarangire and Ngorngoro).

P5 In the first day of the trip it rained in the car, it was during the rain season. 

P6 The accomodation in the Manyara Igloo was ok. 

P7 CUT TO THE CASE... We should have had another night in that Peace hotel we stayed in the first night. We went to Arusha wit a taxi driver coz' the Safari driver should have stayed in Safari for another day. AND THERE the manager told us that we wont stay at the hotel because pr?sident it's in town and there are no rooms left. When I asked him why it wasn't already payed he said that the room was ""complementary"", not like it was in tha package we paid. Like we should have stayed on the streets if it wasn't so 'kind' to offer us a ""technical room"" at the Meru Treks offices, with a llt of lound and unclean bed.

DO NOT GO WITH THEM!!!

This guy is full of surpises.

They didn'¢®¡×t show up. We had to find another a taxi driver in the middle of the night.
The next day we had to hunt ISIA down by phone with the help of the hotel manager.
The trip started 5 hours too late because of this.
We had paid USD70 for an extra event. We didn't get to do this event and still after 4 months we haven't been refunded. I waited this long before writing a review to give them a chance to make it good.
They answer emails sometimes and sometimes not. Lies and stalling. In the beginning they said that they had made the payment but that it will take a couple of weeks before we would see it on the account.
The guide wasn't too interested in talking about animals. He just wanted to drive to get to the next camp and start driving a bit late every day.
He had good contact with other drivers to find animals but that was about it.
In the end he and his boss tried to pressure us to pay USD20 per day in tips and said that this wasn't optional.
You don't need to pay for an expensive company like ISIA!
All companies drive around and talk to each other. Just be sure to get a driver who have been driving for at least 5 years or so. This because a rookie might wreck the car and you will lose time.
There is a million companies out there.
Check what areas you want to go to and what camps you want to live in. Then contact any company but NOT It Started in Africa!
You have been Warned!"
Stephen,AU,Visited: September 2017,20-Oct-17,35-50,first safari,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,2,Half a day and a meal short,"Went to Maasai Mara from/to Nairobi with Wildebeest Safaris. Reviewing the itinerary later, I see that I wasn't provided what was promised for the last day: instead of morning game drives and then an afternoon return to Nairobi by 5 PM, I got an early drive back that was passed off as a ""game drive"" and was returned to the city before lunch. I guess I wasn't paying adequate attention as this was my first time out. Oh well. I think the fault was with the safari organization rather than the guide, so I'll spare naming him in a negative review. In fact I think he did alright, and it was a pleasure to chat with him as we went."
Steve,UK,Visited: November 2018,02-Dec-18,20-35,first safari,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,2,We didn't get what we paid for or what was outlined in the itinerary,"Day 1 - Collection from hotel was fine, on time. No problems with long drive or communication. Itinerary outlined a game drive from 2pm - 6pm, but we only did a game drive for approx 90mins. Lodge was excellent, however that has nothing to do with the tour company.

Day 2 - Full day game drive. Lodge told us to leave as early as possible 7am at latest, driver arranged to start at 8am. We saw everything we wanted to on this day. Lions, Cheetah, Leopard, Giraffe, Elephant, Hippo. However this was more due to the abundance on wildlife and luck than the drivers skill or anything like that. I can't really complain too much about this day, as we saw everything we wanted to.

Day 3 - We were supposed to have a game drive in the morning (leaving the lodge at 8am) before heading straight from the game drive back to Nairobi. However our driver slept in and missed his alarm and we were waiting for him to wake up and were late leaving. Upon arriving at the park entrance our driver welcomed a ""park ranger"" on board who he said we were ""giving him a lift"" we then proceeded into the park, where we just drove on the main road until we happened to chance upon a cheetah, who was starting a hunt. The driver stopped the van and we asked him to put up the roof of the van so we could get a better look, he refused saying it would interfere with the hunt, however he was talking and laughing with other guides in other vans and his phone was ringing loudly,  so I didn't buy that excuse! We asked him again and he still refused, so we had to take pictures through the window. After a few minutes he drove off, and we left the hunt/stalk while it was still in progress/just about to start. We were so annoyed, especially as countless other vans and 4x4s were heading towards the cheetah, while we were driving away from it. We felt like we couldn't complain too much to the driver as we still needed him to take us back to Nairobi and didn't want him to get angry and leave us in the middle of nowhere! He continued driving on the main road through the park and didn't once go on a different road, he then exited the park. Meaning we did not have our morning game drive, he just drove straight through the park from once entrance to another, without lifting the roof - we just happened to stumble across a cheetah. If we hadn't seen that he would not have stopped once! This is not a game drive. We were basically being a taxi service for his friend/ranger. When we got to Narok, the ""park ranger"" exited the van and he continued to take us back to Nairobi, which was fine.

Overall absolutely disgusted with the final day and lack of game drive! The fact that he drove away from a Cheetah hunt that was in progress is absolutely indefensible - and also twice refusing to open the roof so we could look at the Cheetah while we were there.

I don't know if this was just our driver or it is the company (as our driver said he was fairly new to Wildebeest) But I wouldn't use them again!!
I will formally complain to Wildebeest about this...."

There were witnesses.  He apologized profusely over and over again.  My wife was in considerable pain and unable to continue the safari.  We were forced to cancel the trip.  I asked for a partial refund on the safari, but the tour operator refused, claiming it was not their fault and that he is out a lot of money!  Not what you want to hear from your tour operator. 
While accidents can happen on adventure trips, it¢®?s how a company responds to such situations that separate the good ones from the bad ones.  We did not feel safe with this company and are very disappointed.

The schedule they give you is not the actual schedule you will do. Once they have your money and you are actually on safari, your driver will tell you that the schedule the company gives you doesn¢®?t actually matter.

The drivers don¢®?t actually work for the company, they are more like free-lance drivers that take people from different companies. The drivers want to get the most people so they can get more money. So you will drive to place 1, then to place 2, and then back to place 1 to pick up more people. Thus, you spend a lot of time driving the same highways (not on safari) to get more people.

Unfortunately it was unforgettable for all the wrong reasons. The first day we were given a pop top van instead of a 4WD, with not enough room for more than 2 people to stand and our trip to our first lodge was terrifying with our driver who hardly spoke to us passing at great speed on blind corners nearly hitting oncoming vehicles. There was no communication from him about any of the wildlife in the parks. Our accommodation on several occasions was changed (downgraded) with us only finding out on the day. On the last day before going to the border with Tanzania to continue our safari that had been organised through Solaris we had to travel 9 hours instead of the 3 we were told as the vehicle could not go through the National Park - no 4WD.

In Tanzania the company who had been contracted by Solaris, Cross to Africa, had not been paid for our park entrance fees so our guide was constantly trying to get them to pay up. Our organiser, Judy, ended up paying for the park fees and after much persistence received a repayment a month after the end of the safari.

Our accommodation was also downgraded on several occasions in Tanzania by Solaris. It is a pity this experience has caused us to feel we cannot recommend going to Kenya."

Overall our safari experience was overshadowed by the multiple negative experiences our group faced due to poor planning by the tour operator.

It started day one in Nairobi..with confusion regarding number of rooms, and number of days they were booked for..confusion regarding number
veg Vs non veg eaters...etc

there were booking confusions practically at every location...every evening after we had reached our destination, we were to deal with a new problem ..change of itinerary / cancellation for the next day...

Hot air balloon ride over Masai Mara was promised...which got cancelled the previous night, and we were told we would enjoy that at at the end of the trip at Amboseli park...Once at Amboselli, we were told only 28 folks out of 30 can take the ride...which again was sprung as a surprise... at the last minute the balloon operator very casually and callously told us , decide which two of the group would miss the ride...

the tour coordinator travelling with us was not given proper information and authority to resolve the issues...

On the positive side...all the guides/ drivers provided were very good, with deep understanding of the park , animals and environment they were introducing to us...they made sure we got all the experiences of the safari..and were genuinely interested in our trip...

please be very careful if you are planning a trip with Seven By Far Safari..."

Arriving to Serengeti nothing was paid for us. Accomodation, Food, Park entry fees. Not even the free water they promised us was there.
We where stuck in the middle of Serengeti at 10pm, with no place to stay. (we found a place with help from some local guys)

There were no guides as they were on vacation despite it being purportedly a high season. We bought a map for KES 1500 since we could not a guide, but it is extremely difficult to follow given unmarked roads.

The roads are impassable and the stafff are not helpful. We spent two hours looking for a way to cross past the swampy area and despite seeking direction from four staff members, we ended up in the same spot from different directions and had to eventually give up the effort!

One would have expected better guidance including warnings on tricky roads etc.

We did see some rhinos but were very underwhelmed by the seeming lack of knowledge of the lay of the land and even customer service orientation.

We got some perfunctory apologies and were on our way to nurse disappointment especially for the birthday girl who had to wake up early in vain.

The ranch needs to step up its game. Otherwise please consider Ol Pejeta instead."

Few days later the front left tire came completely off on a vehicle and we hit a soft dirt bank, lucky for us. To top it all, complete break failure on a vehicle in Tanzania. We were VERY LUCKY to have a skilled driver who maneuvered his way through a parking lot full of land cruisers and into a ditch, a few feet away from a cell tower, while 8 of us were hanging onto our dear lives, a harrowing experience. One of us had a sprained wrist and a hairline crack and still recovering. We missed out on some of the safari experience due to these accidents and multiple flat tires. We missed out on Ngorongoro.

Suraj,UK,Visited: August 2018,02-Nov-18,20-35,2-5 safaris,Bonfire Adventures,1,Poor organisation and not true to their word,"This trip was so bad that I don't know where to start. Firstly, they provided us with the wrong price online. When we went to the shop in Nairobi, they told us we had to pay extra because we were not Kenyan residents. They knew we were from the UK when we asked for a quote.
Secondly, it was the worst organised trip ever. We booked a 3 day/2 night trip in Masai Mara, and after reading about different trips, we were promised an afternoon game drive on day 1, full day game drive on day 2 and morning game driver on day 3. We were told to meet up with our driver outside the shop on Sunday at 6:45am and no later! We arrived at 6:30am on the Sunday and there was nobody in sight, nor was the office open.  We stood outside in the cold for an one hour hoping that someone would come. After 30 minutes there was a random person with a bonfire adventure top on. When we spoke to him, he told us that we were not his driver and there were no more drivers today. It took us an additional 30 minutes and numerous phone calls to get in touch with our driver. He told us to walk 10 minutes to get to his car.
When we got to the car, it was not a 4x4 as promised, it was a small old-aged van that carried 7 people in the back. We told him what we were promised and he said that the company doesn't have any. We then had to wait for 2 hours because someone was running late. By the time we left, we had 7 people in the car and you literally had hardly any room for your legs.
We knew the journey would be long but because how bad the vehicle was, it was like a rollercoaster. No suspension at all.
Our hotel, Simba Oryx, was incredible! Both the room and the food. I could not recommend it more. Its worth noting though that the hotel was included in the costs but totally separately run so you book any hotel through any safari agency.
When we arrived at our hotel, it was already 4pm and he said the park closes at 6pm. As others were staying in different places, he said he would be back in 30 minutes. He arrived at 5:15 and by the time we got to the safari, we had to get park tickets and so didn't enter until 5:50. We literally drove around for 10 minutes.
The second day, he was late in the morning, picked everyone else up after us. This was after saying he would pick us up first. He gave us a different reason for why he was late to another couple and we ended up missing the run rise.
Now what annoyed me today was day 3. We were promised a morning game drive. Instead he took us to the Masai Village. I explained that this was not the plan but nobody else spoke up and he said that this is always the programme. They expect everyone who comes to the village to pay around $20 per person. I told them that I had paid for everything upfront (and it wasn't cheap!) so there was no way I was paying.
We left the mara at around 11am. Total waste of a day.
In summary, I ended up paying for one day of safari in an uncomfortable over-crowded vehicle. The company is a joke to deal with and don't stick to any promises. Do yourself a favour and stay away from Bonfire Adventures!

The tour went reasonably well, although our guide wasnt really interested in us and only did what he really needed to do.
Our last day was to see the gorillas, they messed up our permits even though we booked and paid 10 months in advance. We had to change our flights and extend the holiday by 2 days for them to sort new permits. Our driver repeatedly tried to get cash from us to pay for petrol as he said Michael was not sending him money.

The repossession company turned up and we were faced with 3 men and the police telling us we would not be let go until Michael paid up. Michael would not answer our calls or theirs, what a nightmare!

Of 5 nights of mobile camping - reserved, confirmed, fully pre-paid - we were cheated out of 2 nights. On arrival we found out that the first night nothing whatsoever had been arranged, other than a back-handed suggestion to stay in some shabby motel in the middle of Maun - and even though our itinerary clearly stated that we would be bush camping in Khwai. We were also told that, on the last night, we would be unceremoniously dumped in Kasane and left to our own devices - and even though our itinerary clearly stated that we would be bush camping in Ihaha. The so-called ""organisation"" was an unmitigated disaster. The vehicles (yes, plural, there was a series of replacement ones as they were in such bad condition!) bordered on dangerous. All the equipment was old, worn, broken (tents), dirty (sheets), badly stained (mattresses), or incomplete (towels never materialised). When I confronted the owner, he did not seem surprised and indicted that other travellers had also had abysmal experiences with Bush Baby Calls. But this did not seem to bother him! At best, ineptitude. At worst, fraudulent. Only saving grace was the actual guides who were superb. For both, it was the first time working freelance for Bush Baby Calls and they were clearly horrified, though too professional (and embarrassed) to discuss the situation. Even the officer at Khwai Gate - when we finally got there! - rolled her eyes and said, ""Not them again , they are always messing up!""

On my first day I ended up alone, pleasant surprise. I was however told that I would stay with the same car and driver all the three days. On my second day I was told we would meet some other people at a junction at 9-9.30. Then I was told they were a bit delayed. Then I was told that we would also swap cars and guide. When we arrived at the junction we found another group in a safari car and we swapped. I asked the other group what happened. They told me there was a problem with the car shaking. I asked the driver and he said ""no, not a big problem"". I was told the people who would join me were a bit late but they would join me in 30 min. I waited 1,5 hours at the junction. And when they told me 30 min the people still hadn't landed at Arusha airport which was more than an hour away. I was told they were delayed. The company lied. 
I eventually reached the park in my shaking car at 12 o'clock. The park was less than an hour away from my accomodation. The shaking was not a small problem, it was a big problem. At the end of the day I had pain in my back. 
On my third day new people arrived..this time they arrived on time. When we finished the safari I asked to be dropped off at my previous hostel since I had arranged a transfer to the airport a few hours later. In the same a car from the safari were a couple who were on a tight deadline to reach their flight on time. The safari company communicates with my hostel and asked them to send the taxi to meet us, so that we could go straight to the airport. I was never consulted. Due to the time pressure of the other people I felt obliged to jump into the car. I arrived at the airport four hours before my departure time and my plans to shower, charge my phone and relax at the hostel vanished. And the safari company 3wonders who charged the couple for the airport transfer conveniantely used my taxi to ship them of to the airport.
I was promised a nice accommodation but I got a very basic one. No hot water unless you told the staff to turn on a switch.  No internet.

PLEASE BE CAREFUL IF YOU PLAN TO CHOOSE THIS COMPANY AND ASK FOR A NEW VEHICLE WITH COMFORTABLE SEATS AND WEFI ONBOARD IF POSSIBLE."
Sylvana,BG,Visited: October 2022,09-Nov-22,35-50,first safari,Seven Wonders Safaris,1,7 disasters,"We booked a package for 11-day safari in Kenya and Tanzania through Parrot Safaris, Kenya. The Kenyan side of the tour was smooth and very well organized. Jose, our tour agent in Kenya, was easily reached and responsive 24-hour a day, even during his days off. We had Maxwell as our guide and driver and he catered about all of us all the time. But our stay in Tanzania was more than disappointing. First, the truck 7 wonders provide was very old. It broke down 3 times in 4 days and finally, we had to be driven back to Arusha from Ngorongoro by other trucks. Not only had we to spend hours in garages waiting for the truck to be repaired, but our driver Linus was totally negligent and I and my husband felt like useless bags. Most of the time he spoke on the phone and often made pauses on the way to Serengeti. He did not care what time we will reach the reserve because had to arrange some private business with a German tourist. We were overtaken by tenths of trucks just waiting on the dusty road for our driver to finish his phone conversations. In the end he was rushing over the bumpy roads in the parks and no wonder, the truck broke down. When I complained to his bosses, Evelyn and George, through our Kenyan agent, I received just apologies, but things did not get better."
T Weber,DE,Visited: February 2019,18-Mar-19,35-50,first safari,Afrikakukaye Tours and Safaris Ltd,1,Terrible tour operator. We were threatened during our tour!,"First of all I would like to make clear that our guide Simon Yuma was incredible and really made our safari an unforgettable experience! THANK YOU SIMON. YOU ARE AN AMAZING PERSON!

Simon has an amazing knowledge about animals and is able to anticipate their behaviour. We saw so many animals super close, which other groups didn¢®?t. I can highly recommend him and I hope that he will find a better employer in the future and here is why:

The company, which was recommended to us, AFRIKA KUKAYE, seemed small but legit. We actually wanted to book with a smaller company then with a big operator. 

We heard many times that on group tours people from different companies were just put together in the same car and everyone having a different itinerary. We said to Remsi that we did NOT want to do it this way. Communication went well and we WERE ASSURED by the owner Remsi Sungwa that we would definitively go with this company.

So far - so good. He confirmed everything. However, 1 day before our Safari was supposed to start, and of course AFTER WE PAYED, he told us that we would be going with another company from his ?long term and highly trusted business colleague DAVID MARO owner of KILI SLOPE.

This led us to be already suspicious. On the day of the Safari our cook had to leave the car, because we were getting a 7th person in the car due to an ?emergency¢®¡Æ they said. I would rather attribute this to their inability to properly organize a tour. 

On the first evening of our Safari we talked to the persons in our group. It turns out that EVERYBODY BOOKED WITH A DIFFERENT OPERATOR AND EVERBODY HAD A DIFFENTENT ITINERARY AND PAYED A DIFFRENT PRICE.  Nobody actually booked with Kili Slope.

Furthermore most of us were promised 3 full days in Serengeti National Park. During this evening we were told that it would ONLY BE 48h because that¢®?s the way the permits in the park work. THIS IS THE PERFECT EXAMPLE ON HOW THESE TOUR OPERATORS CHEAT THEIR CLIENTS. 

Long story shot: Everyone was very angry this evening. I contacted my ?agent¢®¡Æ complaining about this. I was assured that everything will be fine an that I just should enjoy my time.

Next day the 7th person who was squeezed in our car had to wait for another group from Arusha in order to join them. We felt really sorry for him, because he HAD TO WAIT IN THE CAMP INSTEAD OF ENJOYING HIS SAFARI DUE TO DISORGANIZATION of his tour operator.  This made us even more suspicious, because we had an excursion to Lake Manyara on the last day of our itinerary (actually this was supposed to be on our 2nd day, but who cares for the itinerary, right???) and 3 persons in our group did not. One girl had lake Manyara in her itinerary but apparently she was not going to see it because she only booked 5 days Safari and was going back to Arusha with the rest oft he group

Next day we got a call from the owner of Kili Slope Tours Mr DAVID MARO the long trusted business partner of RAMSI SUNWA from AFRIKA KUKAYE:

! Please read this carefully. We have travelled many counties and have been on many tours but this was: the Mount Everest of REALLY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE!!


MR DAVID MARO HEAVYL THREATEND ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND VIA THE PHONE. WE WERE REALLY SCARED AND MY GIRLDFRIEND WAS EVEN AFRAID HE WOULD SEND PEOPLE TO BEAT US UP! THIS IS HOW HE SPOKE TO US!

WE WERE INSTRUCTED NOT TO SPEAK TO THE OTHER PEOPLE IN OUR CAR ABOUT ITINERARIES AND THAT WE HAVE KEEP YOUR quote: ?MOUTHS SHUT AND NOT TO COMPLAIN ANYMORE!¢®¡Æ 

FURTHERMORE HE THREATENED US THAT HE WILL SEND A CAR AND TAKE US BACK TO ARUSHA (I GUESS WITHOUT ANY TYPE A REFUND)


I can only advise everyone who reads this to stay away from Afrika Kukaye and Kili Slope Tours. These guys will treat you like cattle and only want your money. They give a sh*** about you. They do not have the slightest customer service thoughts and will even threaten you if you complain! 


We did our Safari in February 2019 but, to be honest, we first wanted to be out of East Africa before we publish this review. We know that these Tour Operator have a network in East Africa and at that time we were still afraid of consequences posting a negative review about them.

I guess this shows every reader how strong the threat to us felt.

So please, do not book with these people!!

T. Wells,US,Visited: July 2019,29-Sep-19,50-65,first safari,Tree Africa Safaris,2,So much work to get our safari!,"We would not recommend Tree Africa Safaris at all. Throughout the booking process, we thought the company was wonderfully responsive?we dealt with Victor Nagol, who told us we would get a wonderful three-day safari, just as we dreamed of. But as soon as we made our 50% deposit, Victor stopped communicating with us. A few weeks before we were scheduled to arrive in Tanzania, we emailed him to confirm our plans?but our emails bounced back, time and time again. Then we discovered that his company¢®?s website was no longer live, and he was no longer advertising on Safari Bookings. Fearing that we might have been scammed, we asked our son (who is living in Tanzania) to visit Arusha (where Victor¢®?s office was) to figure out what the problem was. He wasn¢®?t able to find Victor, but after spending several days in Arusha, dealing with the police and the other tour company that processed our payment, our son was able to get Victor to follow through with our safari. Victor finally outsourced us to another tour operator (who was wonderful, and who gave us a delightful safari), but every part of it that Victor was involved with was a struggle. Our first two nights in Arusha were supposed to be included in the cost of our safari?but Victor did not pay for them; we had to pay for the hotel and wait to be reimbursed by Victor. He didn¢®?t pre-arrange our accommodations during the safari itself?each night, we had to wait hours until he finally communicated with our tour guide before we knew where we would be sleeping each night. And finally on the last night, Victor did not pay for the hotel we were staying in (in Arusha), which was supposed to be included in the amount we had paid?we had to pay for the hotel when we checked out, and Victor said he would reimburse us for the cost. He did so?but it was weeks after we had left Tanzania and had already returned home.

We ultimately did get a wonderful safari?thanks to the skill and knowledge of the tour guide that we were outsourced to. But every part of the safari that involved Victor Nagol was hard work for us. We have to wonder if the only reason we got any safari at all was because we had our son there, in Arusha, talking to the police on our behalf and putting pressure on Victor to give us the safari we had paid for. 

We cannot in good faith recommend the services of Tree Africa Safaris or Victor Nagol."
Takashi,UK,Visited: December 2018,17-Jan-19,35-50,first safari,Mushra Travel Agency,1,Be aware!!!! Avoid this travel agency!!!!,"The owner of Mushra travel agency Michael Ahabwe Mugerwa is such a untrustworthy!!!!

I am writing this review because I don¢®?t want anyone to have the same bad experience as me and lose any money.  Also they shouldn¢®?t be in this business.
If I write about the whole experience I had with this company it would be such a long review so I will keep it simple but still quite long, sorry. 

1, Micheal changed the original itinerary on Tourradar because on the first day of the tour no one picked me up from the hotel so the 7 day tour became a 6 day tour and I had to pay for an extra nights  accommodation upfront which he has never refunded.

2, The accommodation near to the Queen Elizabeth National Park for the 3 night safari was actually 2 hours drive away from the National park! The first morning game drive we had to leave the hotel at 4am in the morning! So I had to ask to change the accommodation to something closer to the park. 

3, They didn¢®?t pay the activity fee on time to my guide, so I almost missed a few of the activities. For example, the chimpanzee trekking and even the main activity of the GORILLA TREKKING!!!!! Which is the main reason I went to Uganda in the first place!!!! I didn¢®?t want to miss the opportunity to meet the gorillas so I had to pay the permit fee of $600 from my own pocket, of course! Micheal has never refunded that money either.
They use a payment system called ¢®?mobile money¢®? which supposed to be easy and quick so there are no excuses for them to not complete the money transfer to the guide.

4, During the tour the hotel asked my guide to pay the bill upfront but he didn¢®?t have any money because Michael hadn¢®?t transferred it to the guide on time so I had to pay again! Of course, he has never paid me back for that either.

5, On the last day of the tour in the evening I sent some messages to Michael about refunding all of the out of pocket expenses I had accrued and how much stress he had put me under during this tour. He messaged me back and said ¢®?my returning day in Kampala is 1st January which is a public holiday so no one is in the office.¢®? He promised me that he would meet up with me to pay me back when I was back in Kampala!!! There were many excuses to escape from the payment. 

6, In the message he said ¢®¡ÆI am a dishonest person¢®¡¾, ¢®¡ÆI am taking advantage of them¢®¡¾ and he said ""he thinks I was treating them like slaves¢®¡¾ etc.. Shocking!!!! 

I went to Uganda because I just wanted to enjoy my holiday and meet the gorillas not to have extra stress and spend extra money unnecessarily. So please, please, please be careful with this Mushra travel agency and the owner Michael!!!! 
I truly hope Tourradar team will investigate my issues and will protect the future innocent customers."

Paid for the tour in full prior to arriving. Mwanje, the owner, was great to deal with when booking but it all went horribly wrong on arrival. Our driver wasn't paid and we were stranded on the side of the road for 3 hours on the first day. We missed our afternoon game drive and lunch. We went for the 5 star option so for our group we paid over $30k USD for the whole trip. Our first night of accommodation was paid for but after that the next 9 nights had not been paid. The deposit was paid but the remaining amounts were all outstanding. We ended up having to report the matter to police and found that over $20k of the trip had to be paid for again. Our once in a lifetime trip was turned into an absolute nightmare by Mwanje and Image Travel. Mwanje would not respond to our calls or emails. Take my advice and go with another company."

The local agent told me there's no migration at that time of the year(this was the reason why I chose this agency: and they guaranteed this).
The hotel rooms were double (four honeymooners)
the driver of the game drive(safari tour driver) didn't know anything, even directions of the park; it took whole day wondering around the park looking for the resort so wer didn't get to see many animals. 
the safari car regularly broke down and we had to stop in the middle of the park or had tji travel far to get the car fixed. 
this was disaster. 
I complained about this to the agent back in Switzerland but she said it will be taken care of (for 6 months) and she said ""STOP email her about it"". 
There are allot more to tell but I don't even want to spend too much time writing about them. "

Pro-cheapest price, plentiful food, terrific guide

Con-employee who arranged booking insisted I give him the tip money for guide and porters up front rather than allowing me to distribute the money directly to them myself during or after the climb. Upon return from the climb, the employee gave my tip money to the guide. However, the money was not the same as that which I had given to the employee. The denominations of bills were smaller and it appeared some money had been removed. Would not recommend this company as it seems the office-based employee who handles bookings is stealing some of the tip money from the guides and porters who do all the actual hard work on the mountain"

Before I left for Africa, I really had a good communication with Susan/Suzy, she answers questions all the time thru WhatsApp, it's when I arrived in Africa when everything starts to become bad, when I got there, she changed some of my accommodations, the accommodations in the national parks were amazing, I chose the luxury accommodations and they were indeed nice! But my accommodations in Arusha were very bad, she put me in bad places that have dirty rooms, slow shower pressure and stinky rooms! Also, our truck that we used in Tanzania broke down twice, one day we have to spend a few hours in a junk shop in the middle of Serengeti to have the tires fixed then the following day this truck broke down again and we have to hitch a ride with another tour group to go back to Arusha! She booked us thru 7 wonders in Tanzania, I guess this safari company in Tanzania is not reliable! Also in Kenya, they used a van that was converted with a roof that can be lifted during game drives, its not those 4x4 safari trucks! The bad thing about this is it's very bumpy during game drives and roads in Kenya and Tanzania are not paved and very dusty! I just would like to point out that the drivers I had were amazing, Anthony in Kenya and Linus in Tanzania were both nice and they can easily spot animals even if they're very far from the vehicle. Overall, I enjoyed this trip I was able to see the big 5 and I would still do it again but I would probably choose another African countries next time and if I have to be back in Kenya or Tanzania then I'll choose a different tour operator next time "

The guide never showed me or say anything, unless I asked something. I never heard from the owner. We waisted a lot of time looking for a clinic. I had to stayed in Entebbe two more days, I had to pay for another plane to Dubai and for another hotel in Dubai. I wasted a lot of money and time because the owner Couldn¢®?t help me.

I said Alex that I want to have at least the hotel and food costs reimbursed for the last 5 days  reimbursed from him. He promised to tranfer these charges to me within a few days.

Unfortunately I booked with another agent, and was pooled with other bookings, all from different agents. We should have been suspicious that ours was the only vehicle without any branding...it took 4 days to establish which tour company was actually running our trip.

From the outset, it was a shambles. We wasted the entire first morning waiting for various other bookings, essentially until the vehicle was full. I then also had my paid for itinerary changed immediately. To cap it off, the driver / guide was extremely rude, and offered no insight into either the schedule or the wildlife.

During my 5 day trip, the irritation continued. Our vehicle was clearly the slowest on the road, costing us hours of game driving every day. In addition, every time we reached camp, we were the last to leave, and last to eat. And even more, the game driving was not at all in line with the promised schedule. We spent a mere 3 hours in Ngorongoro crater...

Overall the entire trip was awful. It was hard to enjoy the wildlife beauty, as we were all so constantly harassed by the awful experience.

Please do not use this company, and help others to avoid such disappointment too."

I chose to book with Suricata Safaris based on their great reviews (#6 of 1,294 Outdoor Activities in Arusha) and accepted the cost as a part of the great experience I was in for. Weeks in advance, I had emailed the company to confirm this tour was going ahead on that day. Hillary from Suricata Safaris confirmed this.

When the tour started, I quickly realised it was not the 5-star treat I had paid for. Another day in, I realised that we had ended up with Arunga Expeditions & Safaris (#674 of 1,294 Outdoor Activities in Arusha) and their rude personnel. When I asked about this, our driver told me to ""stop complaining"". When I confronted the Suricata representative, Hillary, he said that they moved me to a cheaper operator to save costs. 

My experience with Arunga was very poor. There was no toilet paper, no hot water and no WiFi in the camps, and I shared a small tent with two people (I was told differently when I made my online enquiry with Suricata Safaris). When one of our crew fell ill and needed transportation out of the nature reserve, our guide suggested that we need to sort that ourselves. 

I ended up getting dinner and 10% of my money back from Suricata Safaris after the tour. This really does not make up for the difference in quality for the two tour operators. "

Our dream became a nightmare! 
The Management is the worst I have ever had. On our first day we arrived at the office and the Manager Kassim already yelled at me because I didn¢®?t pay cash and asked to pay by credit card. Then the tour started with an old car (dirty seats, no air condition, broken seatbelts and only 2 windows which could be opened). On our first day the driver had to fix the car twice. On our only day in the Serengeti the car broke down completely. The driver tried to manage everything. We¢®?ve been standing around 4 hours in the middle of the Serengeti. Then the driver arranged a ride to the visitor center for us. There we¢®?ve been waiting another 5 hours. The whole time we didn¢®?t hear anything from Kassim. After calling him and asking what is going to happen because it¢®?s been already 5pm and it normally took us around 2h to get to our accommodation. He apologized for the delay. I told him that this is not a delay! Because of the bad road conditions it took us 4h instead of 2h. So we had to drive 2h in the dark. This was not responsible. Animals had been on the road and we jumped and hurt ourselves because it was not possible to see the humps ahead. So the trip turned into a nightmare. 
But it¢®?s not the fault of the driver. They do their best and they have all the work.  It¢®?s simple the responsibility of the management to organize a good and safe! trip. But as the others already said he doesn¢®?t care about anything (Customer, car, driver) once he got his money.

We contacted Arnold, and he presented himself as a local guide and travel agency, with all the right connections and experience to help us create an unforgettable trip.
After discussing our travel plans, Arnold made us pay a deposit 5 months in advance. He needed it to pay for our accommodations and make reservation with several other travel institutions.
One month prior to our departure we discovered that NONE of the reservations in the accommodations where made ( nor in our name, or his) and nothing was paid. After contacting Arnold he came up with a bunch of excuses and promises to make it right. No real explanation. In the end he stopped answering emails or text messages, and no rectifications were ever made. We ended up booking (very last minute!) through another agency and loosing about 2400 USD. What would have happened if we never double checked with the hotels ourselves ?! Arnold may present himself as genuine and authentic, but unfortunately he is a SCAM!

Tobias,UK,Visited: September 2016,08-Oct-16,20-35,first safari,Kenya Walking Survivors Safaris Ltd,2,Unsure solvency of the company - Definitively not a care free safari!,"First of allthis review has nothing to do with the beauty of Kenya and Tansania nor our personal tour guides or cooks (they have been super helpful)! Both countries are beautiful and their people have been exceptionally friendly and accommodating! 
However, if you want a carefree safari tour in which all bookings/reservations/parking fees are payed in advance (as discussed and payed for) then we suggest to book with a different company. We cannot express how disappointed and frustrated we were in regards to the organizational skills of Kenya Walking Safari's (KWS) management. It caused us many nerves/patience and most of all time during our 10 day safari. 
In order to be fair with KWSS we would also like to say the at the end of our tour KWSS compensated us with approx 5% of the tour price for lost time and wrong calculations.

Anyway we would like to explain what happened:

We booked our safari tour in April 2016 for our trip in August 2016. We had extensive contact with KWS which gave us confidence because they were always very responsive and answered all of our many questions. We payed well in advance (a good amount of money!) and expected that all accommodations/services/park fees would be payed/booked for us in time for our arrival.We are very well aware that we can come across unforeseen circumstances and that flexibility is required. However only to a certain extent.
During our tour we encountered four issues which we would like to explain for others in more detail:

The first issue we encountered was during our first lodge in Maasai Mara. Taking KWS's suggestion, we swapped 1 day in our tour due to ongoing animal migration in the region (adding 1 day in Maasai Mara and take 1 day off from our Tanzania tour).This was a good idea because we were able to see the river crossing. However, we didn't receive the same standard room we booked for originally.We wrote KWS a mail to see how to proceed (since there was a clear down grade on our room).They didn't reply to us until the end of our safari tour.

Second issue:after wonderful game drives in Maasai Mara and a great time at Lake Navaisha we headed off for a very long drive (8h) to Amboseli National park. According to our itinerary (which was reconfirmed verbally and on print during our face to face briefing in the Nairobi office) we were booked at the Kibo Lodge (high class safari lodge). We were then surprised to hear from our tour guide that he had just received a text message from the office saying we would be spending 2 nights in the AA lodge instead of Kibo (another down grade as they have different room rates). Apparently Kibo was fully booked due to government officials.We decided to see for ourselves and were more surprised to hear onsite from Kibo lodge that they did have available rooms and no government officials! We of course did not take the room in the AA lodge and insisted on taking a room in Kibo (according to our tour program we had payed for). We then found out from the hotel manager that they no longer accept KWSS clients because the company has outstanding payments. We (including our tour guide) tried to call the KWSS office many times (including the ""hotline number"") because this was a situation we were not going to accept. We were not able to get the manager of KWSS on the phone and waited 4 long hours until we reached someone from the office.They suggested that we pay the 2 nights ourselves (400$) and we will get a refund. Obviously, after all that we had heard and experienced we were not ready to pay ourselves. Due to the kindness of the Kibo hotel manager and our persisting tour guide we were able to check in at 8.30 pm. KWSS had promised to send the money to Kibo the next day, which they then did the next afternoon.However, low and behold,we encountered another group from KWSS on the second night at Kibo. They had the same problem! Unfortunately they weren't as lucky as we were and had to go to another lodge.

Third issueafter transferring from Kenya to Tanzania,we slept a night in Fanaka lodge to be ready early morning to go to the famous Ngorongoro crater.We were supposed to depart at 8am.However, our tour guide told us that there was a problem because KWSS had again not yet sent the money for our accommodations and park fees for Tanzania. KWSS's Tanzanian business partner, contacted us and suggested we pay 440$ and KWSS will refund us as soon as the money has been wired (apparently there was a technical problem so money transferring was not available). As you may guess, this was not an option for us.KWSS's credibility was non existent. So we called the KWSS office and were surprised that they actually picked up the phone. However this wasn't very helpful and the Tanzanian business partner had to borrow the money from his relative (!) so we could go on with the tour.We waited for almost 3 hrs until we were able to leave.

Fourth issueafter all that had happened, we decided to cross check our past accommodations and realised that KWSS had double calculated the first hotel night in Nairobi. By the waydon't accept a booking at Henessis Hotel.This is a shabby hotel which by far did not meet the standards of our other accommodations. This could have been an honest mistake but we decided to list all the issues we had during our tour for full transparency.

To come to an endAfter many emails and involvement of a 3rd party, KWSS management was cooperative and quick in refunding us (after we finished our tour) for wrong hotel accommodations and lost time (several hundred dollars in total).

In short:

- If you want to do a safari tour do it definitively in Tanzania and Kenya - people (incl. tour guides and cooks), nature and food are amazing!
- If you are looking for a carefree package KWS is not the best option
- If you insist and put pressure on KWSS you probably will get refunded for issues, however we believe this only worked for us because we involved a third party"
Tobias,DK,Visited: March 2018,22-Sep-18,35-50,2-5 safaris,Afrishare Trekking & Safaris,1,"Poor planning, no responsibility for their mistakes.","I'm sad to write that unlike most I had a poor experience with Afrishare.

The guide was ok, but manager Ibrahim was not. Because of poor planning on Ibrahims side we didnt meet the agreed itenerary on the first day. I call Ibrahim with whom I planned the itenerary and tell him that because of this i wnat to pay the last 30% on the last day, so Im sure that I will get what I paid for. This he is absolotely NOT ok with, and he accuses me of trying to avoid payment.

Also he claims that I should pay more than agreed upon in the written agreement. We only managed to reach a solution late on the third day meaning that the first three days was marred by hours of discussion and IT-mistakes by his company leading to us not having time for the planned game drive. 

The arguments got very childish on Ibrahims part: 
1) He argued that I made up IT-issues in order to avoid payment, when in fact his online payment-system was not working, which he in the end admitted, and I was made to make a bank transfer (I had to pay all 80USD bank charges). 
2) He said that he knew my ""personality type"" and that I was making up issues to avoid paying - he said he had had many bad customers like me before. 
3) In the end he kept switching between that I should only pay 700 USD in what he sarcasticly called a ""free safari"" or, that I should pay 2200. I stuck with the 1900 that was in the written agreement in the e-mail. 
4) after spending the first three hours of the second day discussing and trying to work out his IT problems, I asked if we could part ways, and I could pay some of his expenses + take the paid hotel stays with me to another operater. He declined this offer saying I had to pay 2200 because he had paid everything already. Later I found out that he had NOT paid all expenses incl. the 300 USD park fees to Ngorongoro crater. 

I ended up paying 1900 + 80 USD bank/creditcard charges + 50USD tip for the driver for a genuinely bad experience, only after involving hotel manager and threataning with police. My four year old son and I had been looking forward to this for months, and this was both the worst and most expensive holiday ever. Luckily - and most importantly - my son seemed to enjoy most of the safari. Writing this, however, I feel like I should have accepted Ibrahim's 700 USD ""free safari"", though I doubt he would have kept his word."
Tobias,CH,Visited: November 2017,01-Dec-17,35-50,2-5 safaris,Go 2 Africa Luxury safaris,1,Our tour was booked with Go 2 Africa Luxury Safaris but conducted by SandLand Tours,"We booked our individual tour with ""Go 2 Africa Luxury Safaris"". They confirmed the itinerary and all accomodations. They did not tell us anything about a different company making the safari.
These were our experiences:
The tour:
Day 1:
- Due to the bad logistics (people for the tour where missing/coming from a different place, cars where not fueled!) of that company we started at around 11:00 in Arusha although we should have started at 8:00!!! That was our Safari- and holiday-time we missed!
- Accomodation at Jambo Lodge (due to easy logistics for the company) which was not part of our itinerary and of much lower standard than the ones we payed for!
- We asked for local food (as part of the contract). The dinner was planned to be separately from the others. As we said we would like to be together with the rest of the group, after some discussions we got our dinner first with the European food and the local food afterwards?!

Day 2:
- There was no breakfast for us, but prepared for the others. We received our breakfast after longer discussions. There was no coffee for everyone left.
- There was no toilet paper in the lodge. So we had to use our own one.
- We where told that we would get local dinner at Kati Kati tented Camp, but only got bad, cold food.

Day 3:
- We should get breakfast at 6:00 before being picked up at 6:30. Breakfast was ready after the group arrived at around 6:40. After telling the ?guide¢®¡Æ about that problem we got some breakfast and the rest of the group had to wait. - Lost Safari-time again for the whole group.
- At around 11:00 we had brunch for the tented-group and lunch-box for us: There was no place at the table for us, no chairs, no plates. We had to sit outside on the ground in the sun with the lunch box! - That time we told the ?guide¢®¡Æ that we do not except that kind of treatment, that we pay a luxury tour-price and want at least a part of our money back. He was supposed to call and inform his boss - we did not get any feedback or excuse.
- Due to the bad logistics of that company we had to wait unnecessary long time after lunch until we could leave. (our Safari-time again)
- At the border to Ngorongoro NP we had to wait around 2.5 hours although we were first told it should take around 1 hour. During that time we did not get any information. (again: our Safari-time!). We asked a different guide from that company and found out that they made a mess with the wrong permits in advance. The guides had to clear that problem. Abraham told us something completely different, so someone was clearly not telling the truth¢®?

Day 4:
- We left the Ngorongoro NP very early (no lunch in the crater, ¢®?) and arrived early at the Jambo Lodge again (cheaper lodge, easier logistics for Abraham) and did not have any program in the afternoon, which was our holiday time we payed for!
- In the afternoon we were told that we get a local dinner at 19:00, but when we arrived for dinner the chef wanted to seat us with a completely unknown group and serve something completely different. We found out that SandLand Tours just booked the room at the lodge and not the meals that we were told we would get. After long discussions our ?guide¢®¡Æ came and took us to a local restaurant for dinner. We said that he would bring us to his boss after the tour that we could discuss everything with him.

Day 5:
- We had the first breakfast without any trouble (except at Rhino Lodge) but still without coffee, although there was a shop just around the corner.
- Again we had to wait very long to leave.
- After a short trip to Lake Manyara NP we were brought to our hotel directly, but not to the office. When I shortly talked to Abraham at the phone he said he would let us pick up the next day at 8:30 to talk to him and to let us bring to the airport afterwards.
- We were pretty much enraged but talking to the owner of the hotel were we stayed (Sinzia Villas) got us down a bit. He invited us to an excellent local food dinner as he was ashamed for that kind of treatment we experienced (although it was not his fault anyway).

Day 6:
- After some WhatsApp-messages we were picked up at around 9:15.
- The conversation consisted just of excuses, lies (like it was not possible to stay at a camp at Lake Manyara due to mosquitos) and contradictions.
- He said he would give us 150,-$ p.p. and everything would be fine with that¢®?, but he charged us another 30,-$ for the transfer to the airport. He wanted to send us the money to our hotel in Zanzibar and also offer us a free transfer to the airport on our last day.

Safety of the car:
- The wheels did not all have enough profile and seemed decayed.
- The brakes were not strong enough, so you always had to put stones under the wheels that the car did not roll away¢®?
- The ignition did not work properly why you had to push-start the car or park on a hill¢®?
- Many parts of the car were broken (e.g. cooler-box) or temporarily fixed (fold-up-roof)¢®?
- One car of that company was broken why we had to wait while it had to be repaired in Serengeti NP.
- In general the cars do not look well-maintained.

The tourguide:
- Was rarely with the group and did solve arising problems.
- Did not look for the group to find together as a group.
- Did not inform about the tour or times. Only if you asked (when he was there).
- Did not inform when there were problems leading to longer waiting-times (e.g. at the border to Ngorongoro NP).
- Did not maintain the car (at least clean the windows), or refuel during off-times.

One week later:
- After several messages we had not received any money yet, but he arranged the transfer to the airport. We had to drive through Stonetown to meet a friend of Abraham who gave us 230,-$ - He charged the free transfer with overpriced 40,-$ (usually we would have payed 25,-$)!

Two weeks later:
- Now it's two weeks later. We have contacted and informed Go 2 Africa Luxury Safaris. They blame us that we have not informed them before or did not give them all information about this case (although we can prove that we have sent all information in the first mail!). After a meeting between Abraham and Milambo from Go 2 Africa Luxury Safaris we are just accused beeing deceitful, because we want our money (the missing 40$ + a compensation for the resentment and the time consuming mailing back)."
Tom,US,Visited: August 2016,14-Sep-16,20-35,2-5 safaris,Adventure Africa Expedition,1,Strongly recommend not to book here...,"I had a bad experience with this travel company, therefore I would not recommend anyone to book here:

Some good points:
- Pick-up at the airport was well arranged.
- Plenty of game in Masai Mara (but you can see that with any company).
- Good communication before the travel.
However:
- I was booked for a Masai Mara + Lake Nakuru safari. Only upon arrival I was informed I would not go to Lake Nakuru.
- I was put in a different camp than promised on the website. On booking.com it turned out it had a much lower rating than the original proposal. Most people had small to medium stomach problems in the camp.
- On the last day, the driver 'forgot' to pick me up so I missed a morning game drive.
- The trip from Masai Mara back to Nairobi was in a very unsafe van (we broke down once as well) and the driver was driving like crazy and mainly paying attention to his phone. He didn't want to slow down while everyone was asking for it. At one point we slipped off the road and the car finally stopped about half a meter in front of a tree.

I informed the company on this after my trip. For the first weeks I did not get any response. As I kept reminding them they finally gave response saying everything that happened was out of their control. I asked for a refund however they were not willing to compensate."
Tom,UK,Visited: June 2018,12-Aug-18,20-35,first safari,Prime Safaris & Tours,1,"Safety, Planning, Transparency and Trust were at the heart of it...","Prime Safaris Uganda gave a good first impression. Cate wrote in a welcoming and professional manner with strong salesmanship. The emails were filled with ¢®?exciting¢®?, ¢®?thrilling¢®?, ¢®?adventure¢®?, ¢®?amazing¢®?, ¢®?rewarding¢®? and many more positives. It was to be a 21 day custom trip starting in Rwanda and traversing throughout Uganda using budget accommodation. I was swayed to pay an average of ?300 a day for the trip. I had high hopes.
The trip didn¢®?t go well at all. I¢®?ll start by describing safety concerns then describe some of the days in relation to the accuracy, transparency and planning. At the end is a series of tips worth reading to prepare for a safari in Uganda or nearby.
 
3 of the lodges had Mosquito Nets which were torn, with holes in or not properly attached to the bed. Both the guide and myself frequently ended up with stomach problems so I gave him some of my medicine to help
The car was in serious disrepair. Loose electric cables and faulty air conditioning which worked half the time and regularly leaked onto the feet.
Later on, the speedometer and other instruments stopped working. The guide mentioned that we¢®?d be lucky not to be stopped by the police.
 
One of days early in the trip was a visit to Lake Bunyonyi. We reached at midday and the guide left me at a lodge on an island while he looked for accommodation on shore. He soon messaged me to say the car¢®?s axle broke and he'd search for a replacement part. I did not see or hear from him until the following day. When I raised this with Prime Safaris, they responded with a defensive email denying the breakdown happened at all. I couldn't tell if the guide was lying or they were. Two days later, I was left alone again while the guide said he would take the car to get the AC repaired. Later, in conversation, he mentioned that he tried repairing it using tape so I'm not sure where he went that day. It wasn't repaired and began leaking again.
 
A day on the itinerary had a briefing of ¢®¡Æamazing cycling experience traversing the Fort Portal Crater field with scenic crater lakes and hollows. From the activity, transfer to Lake Albert enjoying the views of Albertine Rift valley including the scenic flats, escarpments and the Blue Mountains of Congo. Enjoy a thrilling bush dinner under the lush tropical sky.¢®¡¾
The day had under an hour of cycling along a city road. It was really disappointing and made worse by all available bikes having grave faults including some with nonfunctional brakes. I went with working brakes but faulty gears. 
Before we set off along the road to the Amabere caves, I asked for a helmet for safety but they said they had none. We cycled at a leisurely speed but, strangely the bike guide needed to pause every few minutes to regain his breath. The remainder of the trip, cycling up to the crater lakes, was cancelled due to lack of time.

After driving back to town, we had a rushed lunch and the Prime Safaris guide admitted he was surprised all this activity and distance to travel was planned for a single day. We set off at 1pm and drove at full speed to reach by 8pm, luckily sooner than expected because the guide managed to find out about a shortcut from speaking to locals. When we reached, the reception said it was too late for the bush dinner and we would have needed to have arrived by 6pm for it to be ready. Later, while waiting for a meal, I conversed with a member of staff and learnt that they hadn¢®?t even received a request for the bush dinner in advance. I raised concerns with Cate by email and she responded again with hostility, asserting that I was an hour late to breakfast and took multiple stops of 30-40 minutes. ¢®¡ÆThe guide advised against such stops which would cause late arrival but you said it was okay for late arrival¢®¡¾. I was taken aback as it wasn¢®?t true. It became clear that they phoned the guide and he came up with these lies to try and defend himself. It shows that Prime Safaris are not interested in listening to their customers, only in defending their mistakes.
 
Another surprise was a day described in the itinerary as ¢®¡ÆTake up a lasting authentic cultural to the indigenous Karimojong on the great hills of Mount Morungole.¢®¡¾ ¢®¡ÆIt¢®?s an active adventure to the Mountains and it¢®?s a whole day experience with great sightseeing as well.¢®¡¾
It turned out to be a short drive to a nearby small town where a local gave a brief spoken tour of their customs. It was all there was to do so we drove back to the lodge to rest before having lunch. The guide said he knew that this was what to expect and he¢®?s unsure why the office described it as a full day with active adventure.
A similar falsehood occurred earlier in the trip with the activity at Lake Bunyonyi described as ¢®¡Ædo canoe paddle exploring the Island Communities & the fishermen¢®¡¾, ¢®¡Æa canoe ride exploring this amazing lake, hopping between Islands and visiting the Islands to view the way of life of the Islanders and their traditions.¢®¡¾ It turned out to be a motor boat trip with a member of staff from the lodge talking a bit about the history of the area. He didn¢®?t know what else to offer so stopped at a nearby market and chatted to locals he knew.
There are many other examples of the experience not matching the itinerary that was sold.
 
To conclude, the initial customer service, exciting itinerary and great expense gave me high hopes. When things started going wrong and Prime Safaris put me at great discomfort, I raised the concerns with Cate by email. I asked her to focus constructively on the remainder of the trip and hoped for the best. Surprisingly, I received defensive and hostile replies, dismissing all the concerns. Prime Safaris were not interested.
Following each email, the office phoned my guide a number of times and became very aggressive with him. It made him visibly upset, trying to defend himself, and the trip deteriorated as a result. Feeling we were both victims, I chose to confide in him and mentioned that I might request a partial refund. 
When I returned to the UK, I received a very hostile email from Cate who stated she was disappointed I did not want to meet her and her peers at their office, revealing that they gathered ¢®¡Æa comprehensive day to day report about what transpired during your tour, photos, voice recordings and videos which we had intended to share with you¢®¡¾. Realising that they wanted to intimidate me with recordings made behind my back, I was relieved I did not meet them.
The email ended with Cate stating that Prime Safaris ¢®¡Æare satisfied that you got your moneys worth and are not giving back any refund what so ever. Wishing you a wonderful stay back home.¢®¡¾
 
By no means am I trying to say the entire experience was awful but, when you consider that I spent ?6000 for a 21-day trip and could have realistically hired a quality guide myself, BOUGHT a car that was reliable and had a much better experience for a lot less money, it was a huge regret going with Prime Safaris.
 
Tips
? Remember insect repellent and lots of anti-diarrhoea medicine.
? Bring a few lightweight long-sleeved shirts to protect against insects and sun
? Bring something warm if you¢®?re visiting high altitudes.
? Use a walking stick if going walking; many paths aren¢®?t maintained and can be very slippery. They¢®?re often provided.
? Brace yourselves for small lizards about the accommodation ? might find them moving across the walls in your room. If you¢®?re in a sealed tent, have a look around to make sure one didn¢®?t get trapped in.
? Two weeks max is more than enough to see the best bits.
? Check the route planning if you¢®?re using a customised itinerary and watch out for days where there¢®?s a tight squeeze for participating in activities and making long drives.
? Avoid Queen Elizabeth national park in Uganda. Guides I spoke to said many companies leave it out because the growth of nearby towns caused wildlife to migrate.
? Many guides are primarily experienced in driving and networking, not wildlife. If you¢®?re concerned with competency of the guide, don¢®?t hesitate to ask for a new one. Part way through the trip, I lost trust in the guide and requested a new one. Steven Ashley replaced him and turned out to be a brilliant guide with great enthusiasm and experience. He told me he¢®?s happy to arrange safaris directly. Message me if you¢®?d like his email.
? If you do go with Prime Safaris, ask for Steven Ashley as your guide. Steven is someone who always has a smile on his face and his positivity makes you forget about the failures the company makes."

Tomer C,US,Visited: June 2017,15-Jun-17,20-35,first safari,Bramwel Safaris | Tanzania,1,"Do not use Bramwel Tours, William Amon, or Meru Treks. Awful experience and they owe me $382","In August 2016, I signed up for a 6 day camping safari with Bramwel tours, operated by William Amon in Arusha. The cost was $1,200 and the itinerary that William sent me included all transfers and one night stay at a hotel after the tour was over. I was traveling alone so I asked William if I could join another tour. He said yes. I chose William because he was responsive and helpful over email. He answered all my questions in a professional manner.

Two days before the tour started, William emailed me to tell me that the tourists I was supposed to join had cancelled. He found another tour operator with a 5 day tour the same days and I could join them. I was disappointed, especially because the shorter tour meant I wouldn't be able to see the great migration (the primary reason I wanted to go on Safari), but I understood that happens when you join other tourists. William suggested they would find a local activity in Arusha to fill my sixth day.

The tour operator William put me on (Meru Treks) was awful! We lost a lot of time because the jeep kept breaking down, and we started so late one day that we missed half the day. Another day, when we went to Ngorongoro crater, the driver told us we would only have half a day, even though the itinerary told us we'd have a full day. We had to argue with our driver to get a full day.

The driver was in a bad mood some of the time and explained very little to us.  The cook was nice and did the best with the food he had, but some nights there wasn't enough food for the group.  

Everything about the tour suggested Meru was trying to spend as little as possible.  For example, we found out that the driver and cook had nowhere to sleep!  The driver was sleeping in the car (no wonder he was in a bad mood and no wonder that some mornings we started late).

Along with me on my tour were five other people, all of whom told me they were very unhappy. Two of them paid $680 for four days.  One paid $640 for four days.  Two other tourists paid $900 for five days. They all purchased their tickets directly through Meru.

The night before I returned, I emailed William to tell him how awful Meru was. I told him I don't want to hire him for my sixth day, and I'd like a refund for the difference between the price of the Meru Trek tour and the tour I paid for. He agreed, told me he would meet me in Arusha and pay me the difference.

When I arrived in Arusha, the hotel that was supposed to be included in the cost of my trek told me that William had paid part of the room cost and I would have to pay the remaining $32.

I emailed William to tell him I thought the Meru Trek should have cost $850 (the tourists who paid $680 for a four day trip paid $170 per day; my five day trip should have cost $850). I told William I thought he owed me $382 ($1,200 - $850 + $32). He responded that he only owed $230. He tried to charge me $50 for airport transfers and $20 for the night in the hotel, even though both of these were listed as 'included' in the itinerary he sent me. After some arguing, he agreed to refund me $382.

On my last day in Arusha, William emailed me to apologize that he would not be able to meet me to refund my money. He said he would wire me the difference.

For the last ten months, we have been emailing back and forth. William keeps promising he will refund my money, but he never does. He once told me he sent it but the money did not arrive in my account.

Altogether, I am very upset at Bramwel, William, and at Meru Treks. The trek I went on was a big disappointment. William pushed me off onto a bad operator, and then tried to charge me extra for items that should have been included. While he has agreed to pay me $382, he has not refunded my money.

I strongly agree with all the other negative reviews posted on SafariBookings. I recommend you stay away from Bramwel Tours, William Amon, and Meru Treks. I have emailed the Tanzania Tourism Board to recommend that they take away Bramwel's license."
Tonja,SI,Visited: July 2022,13-Aug-22,20-35,first safari,KAMar Safaris,1,We regret booking with this safari company,"We are two backpackers who allways trying to see good things on our trips. We ordered safari trip (Tarangire, Ngorongoro) which included a flight from Znz to Arusha.
The only bright spot was unforgetable experience seeing those beautiful animals at the parks and our safari guide Molel because of his knowledge about wildlife. 
The rest of the organization was a disaster. We were directed to the wrong flight at Znz airport. If we wouldn't figure it out last minutes before departure, the plane would leave without us. The guy working for company didn't even look at our tickets, he just send us to the wrong group. When we came to Arusha, nobody was there to pick us up. We spend 1 hour browsing on the web for their contacts with the local people. The whole thing looked like their company didn't even exist. That morning was extremely stressful for us. Thanks for the kind-hearted locals who helped us find a guide who was 1 hour late and airport employee who stopped the flight for us.
When we came to the safari we said: ""Okay, let's forget about this, we solved this out."" But at the end of the trip again there were problems with transportation back to Znz. Also the things that were written in the plan about the trip weren't real (both days the park ride was shorter than it was written, they wanted the money from us for the dinner which was included in the plan.)
We had a deal that we will fly back to Znz in the morning. We didn't recieved info about the flight till late evening and we were asking them for informations all the time. We got the flight tickets at the airport. 
They were telling us there were so many mistakes because we ordered this trip ""last minute"" (3 days before). We did get an apollogy from a driver.
We could write more, but we believe you allready got an impression why we don't recommend this company.

Tony Fishman,ZW,Visited: July 2017,17-Jul-17,20-35,first safari,Kapolondo Expeditions,2,"Don't book with this company, you'll be desappointed","We booked a group tour and paid for it a couple of months in advance. We aggreed with Tony on a particular itinerary that we carefuly planned out, including 4 safari NP, a walking safari, two tracks and a list of specific lodges we wanted. 
When we started the tour it slowly became obvious that we were taken on one of the regular itineraries instead of the one we agreed on. Every day we had to argue about the schedule and make Tony change our route. After one such argument we got our walking safary, only to be taken to literaly a sheep-shit full field nowhere near the reservation. It took some more arguing and nerves for us to be taken on a ""real"" walking safari. Needless to say that most of the lodges were not the ones aggreed upon in advance, though it being the off season I have to say the lodges we stayed in were more or less on the same level. Still frustrating. Our driver guide was more of a driver than a guide, most of the time just driving us around in quiet. To top it all, the jeep was old and in horrific condition. The ceiling leeked water throughout the tour and we had no less than 6 flat tiers, the last 2 happening in the midst of the Serengeti NP with no spares and no cellphone connection. Luckily we were picked up by another tour group, but than spent the entire day at the hotel waiting for our driver guide to fix the car. No need to tell you how expencive a safari day is and how annoying it is to miss one like that. Got to say Tony paid us back half the price for the day, still waiting on the other half.
In short, very frustraiting. All that we agreed on in advance was completely meaningless as far as Tony was concerned. Don't book a tour with him."
Tori,NZ,Visited: September 2019,09-Sep-19,20-35,2-5 safaris,Enrico¢®?s Tours and Safaris,1,WARNING!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!!,"WARNING!!! DO NOT USE THIS COMPANY!!!! 

We were booked on a seven night safari with Enrico¢®?s. We booked about 6 months in advance and paid in advance. 

The day that our safari was supposed to commence, no one showed up. We could not get in contact with the company to find out what was going on (we tried their phone numbers, whatsapp, email, Facebook etc). When we finally got in contact (after hours and hours of trying), we were told someone would be there by 2:30pm at the latest. Again, no one showed up. Again, we could not get in contact with Enrico¢®?s to find out what was going on. When we did get in contact, he suggested that we arrange and pay for our own transfer to what was supposed to be our first stop?? Eventually our then-current accommodation offered for us to stay another night and Enrico¢®?s promised to pick us up at 9am the next morning. Enrico¢®?s said they would pay for the accomodation, but they did not and we had to pay for it. 

At 9am the next morning, surprise surprise, no one showed up!! And again we could not get in contact with Enrico¢®?s to find out what was going on!! We were finally picked up at around 11:30am (1.5 days late for our six day tour...) in a minivan with worn out suspension that was supposed to drive us on sand/gravel roads in between destinations - even our driver said it was unsafe and that he didn¢®?t think the car would be able to make the journey!

We found out our was a freelancer that was called by Enrico¢®?s at 7am on the day that our safari was meant to commence to get to us in Kasane from Windhoek. It is 1,400kms and 14 hours away from our pick up point. There was no way they were going to be able to pick us up at the scheduled pick up time and no way they would even get to us by 2:30pm so I have no idea why this was promised by Enrico¢®?s. It also meant that Enrico¢®?s knew that this would not be possible before 7am the day of our safari and they never contacted us to tell us this. We could have done activities that day through our then-current accomodation, but instead spent an entire day in reception trying to get in contact with Enrico¢®?s!!

When we finally arrived at our first accommodation, NOTHING had been booked or paid for! The accomodation had never heard from Enrico¢®?s and did not know we were coming! Apparently this is a very common occurrence and our driver had heard of this happening regularly before. Luckily we could get in for one night (the last two rooms) but again had to pay for this ourselves!!! We were paying for our whole trip twice!! 

We found out we had not been booked into our next accommodation and none of our activities had been booked. Again, we could not get hold of him to find out what the hell was going on! One time we called off our driver¢®?s phone and when he heard our voice he hung up!! When we finally got in contact much later, he said he could get us into some other accommodation but we would have to pay for it and be refunded. Obviously we were not going to do that, and after such an incomprehensibly terrible experience. 

We found out that he has been banned from the camps in National Parks in Namibia for non-payment. He doesn¢®?t pay his drivers or guides on time. Our driver says he has a reputation for being a terrible tour operator - I have no idea how his business survives. 

He lied to us continuously to try cover the mess up. He should not be allowed to offer these services. We are reporting him to tourist organisations so that our experience does not become someone else¢®?s. 

Luckily we booked through Tour Radar so we were able to get a full refund. "
Travelforfun,US,Visited: October 2023,23-Oct-23,65+,first safari,African Sunsets Travel,2,Not reliable - questionable business practices.,"If you only read the first paragraph of this review, we would highly suggest you do not book your next vacation with with Sunsets in Africa. Do book your tour through TourRadar and if you are searching for outstanding transportation, consider using Professional Safaris based in Arusha, Tanzania. For reference purposes, our trip was a 15 day safari to Kenya and Tanzania. 

Why not use Sunsets in Africa? They are not reliable nor in our opinion completely honest. We just want others to not experience what we did while in Africa. A vacation should be a vacation not an anxiety filled and somewhat intimidating experience. Let me explain.

The good: Kenya and Tanzania are truly special and even though our original tour operator was on the edge of awful, the countries themselves were wonderful. We loved the people, the scenery and the animals we encountered. And the hotels in Kenya booked by Sunsets in Africa were the ones we asked for and were paid for prior to our arrival in Kenya. We are not sure about the hotels in Tanzania because we did not use them. More information below.

The Bad:  We arrived and thankfully our hotel provided us with transportation to our lodge. However, once we were picked up by our safari driver in Kenya, we found out a couple days into our vacation that his company (Sunsets in Africa subcontracts out the transportation) had not been paid for our transportation and at one point our driver told us his manager said to just leave us in the Maasai Mara. Whether or not this was true is unknown. A call to Sunsets in Africa was answered by Gladys who said the transportation company can't do that and she would take care of the issue. Yea right. She texted me to not worry everything was fine. The next day or two we were told that Sunsets in Africa had not paid anything and more than more than 30 calls on WhatsApp to both Dexter and Gladys, co-owners of Sunsets in Africa, were ignored. Dexter was available but choose not to answer. At this point, we felt as if we were being mislead by everyone including the transportation companies in Kenya, Tanzania and Sunsets in Africa. I guess the breaking point was when I read a message sent by Dexter to the owner of the transportation company in Tanzania saying that I had agreed to pay for the transportation in both Kenya and Tanzania. I wrote to Dexter and told him I never agreed to this and why would I because I had already paid for transportation! He never reached out to me to discuss this and frankly, there was no way I was going to pay twice even if he promised to pay me back.  At that point, I reached out to our planned transportation company in Tanzania and I asked if they were canceling our tour. Response, ""I'm not canceling your trip. Just need some money to facilitate your program"". I asked why he couldn't wait to be paid by Sunset's in Africa? Didn't he trust the company to pay him? His answer was, ""I really trust him but I have no cash to facilitate your program"". Doesn't this feel like a shakedown? We had it at that point. Between the two transportation companies, they wanted me to send them ~$4700. Can you imagine? 

The Solution: Thankfully, we did a bit of research and realized we had originally paid for our trip through TourRadar. A quick call and TourRadar put in motion changes. They paid for the outstanding transportation bill in Kenya, they rebooked all our remaining hotels and booked a new transportation company (Professional Safaris). Thanks to Kristina at TourRadar, the rest of our trip was outstanding! And I can't say enough about Gerald our driver, Medcine owner of Professional Safaris in Tanzania and TourRadar who saved our vacation. These companies are  outstanding and more importantly, honest. We would highly recommend both organizations and especially Gerald!!

Finally: Just so you think this just happened to us, we met another group that used Sunsets in Africa and they too experienced the same issues. Unfortunately, they ended up paying for all the unpaid transportation in both Kenya and Tanzania. I'm not sure if they ended up paying for their hotels as well. Their only recourse to file a report at the police station in Nairobi, and hope their travel insurance covered the charges or credit card reversing the charges. Sad. We heard of a third group as well but this can be construed as hearsay. 

I know this review is long and it does not even cover all the issues we experienced before and during our trip. Do yourself a favor. Find a reputable company that pays their subcontractors before you arrive! "
Trevino,CN,Visited: September 2023,11-Nov-23,20-35,2-5 safaris,Shemeji Safari Tanzania,1,We believe we are trapped and treaded unfairly,"We are 4 friends and booked our trip to Tanzania from 09/24 - 10/4. And we¢®?ve planned our trip like more than half year ago, we are so looking forward to have an impressive and unforgettable trip. But it turned out that we are just trapped and treated unfairly:

1) Request are neglected 
during the book??we have highlighted that we need twin room(2 beds in 1 room), and the company had confirmed the request in our itinerary in the email. But it turned out that the company just ignored the request and there are always only 1 bed in 1 room.

During the Serengeti safari, we can overcome the difficulty as there is only 1 night and with the help of receptionist, we finally have 2 beds in one room. Although 1 is king size the other is baby size.

But when we arrived at Zanzibar, there are straight 3 nights! And when we turn to receptionist, he confirmed that there is no request for the room and it cannot be arranged. At the time I called Mirene, our customer service representative from the company, she just said I NEVER request!!! 

2)  forgot to arrange activities with payment 

We booked dolphin adventure and but there no one knows the schedule onsite. 
 
We check with the reception desk, they let us ask the excursions and taxi office. And the office asked us to wait at the front desk today at 6 am¢®?. 
 
We just wait at front desk today at 6 am as we are told, but there is no driver, the receptionist tried to call someone to help. And we are waiting half an hour. The driver finally showed up and took us to the North saying the staff forgot to arrange the adventure to us. And because it is too late, cannot take us to the south, which list in our itinerary, he can only take us to the north as it is closer.

3) Payment change without notice
We are informed fully that the credit card payment rate is 2.5%, but when we pay it was updated to 3%. We find the balance is not right and reached out to the company and only when they told us that because the government changed the rate.

4)  careless and time wasting
We have reported to the company on 10/1 and want to have a solution of the unhappiness, and till now 11/11 we don¢®?t have the solution. And the reply just keep saying they are contacting accountant (don¢®?t understand why need to contact the person) and asking the same question even though we have demonstrated exactly in the email of what we need and what happened.

the route of keeping letting us down in summary 

A. the credit card payment rate rise from 2.5% to 3% without notice until we find the difference. And we accept it;
B. Full of lies: One of my friends reached out to Mirene to help know who is our pickup guy at airport. And Mirene replied she will contact me to confirm. And I never received her email so I have to write to her. And she wrote me back¢®¡¾ she never got message from my friend¢®¡¾ ( we have both WhatsApp and email record if you need). Again we accept it.
C. During the safari, the room is also only 1 bed. As you may know already. We accept it with the receptionist help.
When we back to Arusha, we immediately write back to Mirene that we are very happy with our arrangement as we want to know the time that pick up tomorrow! And of course, you may need to give credit to  wild animals who help erase our unhappiness.
D. And finally our disappointment has reached to its ultimate level in Zanzibar when we step into our room. So I immediately write email to the company but they just keep pulling back and forth.

We truly want to know, the difficulty the company set for us is because we are Asian? or more specifically speaking, we are treated unfairly is because we are Chinese?"
Tyler,US,Visited: April 2023,25-May-23,20-35,over 5 safaris,Dancing Simba Safaris,2,Choose another company,"The Good: The safaris were incredible. Ngorongoro in particular was amazing. Lots of wildlife. We were worried about traveling during the ¢®¡Æoff¢®¡¾ wet season, but it was amazing. Best safari so far in all of Africa. Keep in mind, the safari host is subcontracted.

The Bad: Communication before and during the tour was abysmal. We had no idea what was going on at any time and David did a poor job of confirming plans. We had to have backup plans upon arrival at the airport because we weren¢®?t even sure if we were going to be picked up due to a lack of communication and confirmation.

The UglyFig Tree Lodge, the Eco Lodge with which Dancing Simba contracts several stays, is pretty terrible. Mama Pia is a delight, but the rest of the staff are rude and it feels like a scam. A dirty one at that. Several of the tours felt the same way, including the coffee tour near Materuni Falls, Mto Wa Mbu, and the Maasai people nearby. 

All in all, we made the best of it, but Dancing Simba was absolutely not the catalyst that made this trip amazing. We¢®?ve traveled over 75 countries and have done many safaris and weeklong tours with guides. Highly encourage you to do your homework and book this type of trip with someone else, especially at this cost."
Ulrich,DE,Visited: April 2022,13-Apr-22,20-35,2-5 safaris,Bella safaris Limited,1,Scam,"Felt like a scam.

We booked a 2 day safari for the amboseli park and were staying at the kibo lodge.
First of all the driver was about 45 min. late and totally exhausted, he even told us that he only slept one hour and nearly fell asleep at the wheel. When we wanted to enter the park, for some reason we had to wait another hour while the driver was on the phone while all other cars were getting through the check point within 5 minutes.
The second day, the driver let us wait again, having breakfast while we wanted to go for a game drive.
When we called bella safaris with our complaint, the sales woman told us that the driver had another safari the day before and that's why he was so tired and then simply hung up.

The only thing that didn't make this trip a total catastrophe was also the only thing not under control of bella safaris: the wildlife of the amboseli park."

I had communication with Magdalene. Our driver Steve tried to cancel part of our safari tour in order to try and pocket the entrance fees we had already paid the company! He confronted us during our family dinner to try to talk us out of it! How disrespectful and unprofessional! I never felt so insulted in my life. I contacted Magdalene who informed me I would be refunded and once I replied to confirm yes send me back my money I never heard one word back!! Do not trust this company. You should not have to go through this when visiting an unknown third world country. Of course safari is a great experience but you can experience all the wonderful things with ANY other company who has reliable staff and drivers, there are so many which shouldn¢®?t try to cheat and steal from you!

Valentina,AU,Visited: September 2023,12-Nov-23,20-35,first safari,Paradise & Wilderness,2,Poorly organised & we still haven't been refunded for cancelled activity,"- Before the trip even started, communication (regarding payment & our pickup arrangement) with our booking agent was so terrible to a point where we suspected the legitimacy of this company. 
- We had to chase our booking agent numerous times (payment has been made at this point) before he finally sent us a pickup driver's contact details
- Before we departed, we sent the pickup driver a message to confirm. He was surprised to hear from us as he wasn't aware of this pickup arrangement and said no-one had contacted him, nevertheless he still agreed to pick us up when we arrive (thank god).
- We we arrived, the pickup driver had no idea where to drop us off as he did not know anything about our itinerary. After many phone calls, he finally found out where we were staying and managed to drop us off at out accommodation. However he did not work for this company and it was still unclear why our booking agent had given us his details.
- the next day we found out one of our activities in Arusha wasn't booked and we had no idea until we arrived (after driving aimlessly for 2 hours).
- We requested for a refund for this cancelled activity as well as our accommodation for the night (as we wouldn't have booked accommodation for that night if it wasn't for the activity mentioned above).
- Staff agreed to refund the activity and suggested they would confirm with their management team and try to refund the accommodation, and promised to sort this out for us before our trip ends. We believe their words.
- After coming back from safari, we returned to Arusha for 1 extra day, We contacted the staff regarding our refund, they said they were still working on it.
- It's been a month since we are back from the trip, we have been contacting the company regarding this matter, and we have been ignored. 
- It's been a really dodgy experience overall. Do yourself a favour and avoid this company."

For our first day, instead of leaving Nairobi befor 9am we were delayed until 10 am, going with the driver pick up food and oil....

We were 6 people in the van at that time: 2 coming from Absolute Safari, 2 coming from Big Time Safari and the other 2 coming from Savannah Jamboree Travel. The bus was managed by Big Time Safari but what I understood is that many budget companies work together in order to incease occupancy rates of the vans.

Valerio,IT,Visited: August 2023,25-Nov-23,50-65,over 5 safaris,Kima Adventures,1,Terrible experience,"Attention!  do not go to any of these safari agencies (Kilimanjaro Adventure Safari Club, Kima, Safari Moja Matata) especially not to Mister Thomas. I think they are scammers.
We paid Mr. Thomas 3800 USD to have a 8 days safari, at the end of July 2023: Serengeti, Lake Natron, Olduvai Gorge, lake Maniara. Starting from Arusha. He promised us the new car which pics he sent us by whatsapp when we contacted him, but a very old Toyota was used for our safari. The car was very very old and dangerous and Mr Thomas put us in a very serious DANGER and RISK for our LIVES! AND HE KNEW IT. That was a criminal way to work with people.

First of all, we paid Kilimanjaro Adventure Safari Club; the safari program was by KIMA company, and to enter the parks the name of the company was Safari Moja Matata. We don't know what happened.

The Toyota Prado sx 30 turbo (plate? T457 ANR) had very worn tyres, left windows and doors didn't work (we can't get out of the car, we can't close the windows when the road was dusty), brakes didn't work and produced smoke and bud smell, brake fluid came out from the left front wheel, rear shock absorbers didn't work so the car skided dangerously and the engine made strange noises. The car was very very dirty and rusted. The driver (Juma) had to drive very slowly because the car swerving when improved the speed, so we lost a lot of time for visiting the parks. We were very afraid for our safety.

After a day driving, we wrote and phoned to Thomas to ask him for changing the car for a better one as those in the picture he sent, but he said it was the only avaible car. He said the car was ok, but it wasn't at all.?

In fact, on 25th July one of the bald tyres broke. They mount the spare wheel but he broke after 20 meters! The spare tyre was very bald too.

We stand on the road for hours to wait for new wheels. I called Thomas to protest, he said we was right and he would refund us for that day, but he didn't it. That was the last time he answered at calling or sending messages.

Finally Thomas sent a private car that carried us to Lake Natron but we arrived in late and we had only 2 hours to visit the side in a great hurry.?

By night, the driver Juma arrived to Natron with the same old car again and 2 new tyres and we continued the safari on the same old car.

The safari continued driving always very very slowly and we always must wait 2/3 ours for the payment for entering the parks because Thoms were always in late in that. We lost a lot of time every time.

On 27th July in Serengeti the brake fluid came out from a wheel that made bad noises. So we couldn't arrive to Serengeti Central and we had to pass the first night in another camping near the border of the park. Because of the slow driving and the in late payments we arrived on 28th July to Olduvai Gorge only 1 our before the closing! INCREDIBLE! We have no enought time to visit all we wanted.

On 29th July, during descending Ngorongoro slope, brakes caught fire! The company put us in a great danger! We could have a serious accident during the deep descent. A lot of other drivers stopped to advise us about the dangerous situation.?

On the way back, climbing the Ngorongoro slope, the car stopped because the engine produced smoke. We all pushed the car trying to restart the car unsuccessfully. Another car gave a ride to the top of the slope. The old and dangerous car broke definitely and our driver left it in Ngorongoro.

We remained with no safari car, and we continued our safari changing different private cars for the remaining 2 days with great discomforts and delays, while you disappeared at all!
On the way back to Arusha we went to the Arusha Tourist & Diplomatic Police station to make a report to the police.
The police said that surely one of the three safari  companies was a fake.
Our safari and our holiday are ruined, and we risked our lives!
After the report at the police,  Mr Thomas promised to refund us 1500 USD, but he disappeared without doing it."
Vanessa,IT,Visited: July 2023,04-Aug-23,20-35,first safari,Karibu Safaris In Kenya,2,Disappointing.,"We booked the safati two nights and three days.
Upon arrival in the morning at their offices they were disorganised, they left us stationary for an hour and a half inside the investigating judge while all the other investigating judges had already left. To avoid arriving too late for the first game, the guide suggests that we stop for lunch halfway, a pity that it was at our expense when instead it was included in the price in the booking.
During the booking phase, I specify that I want an Italian-speaking guide, they confirm availability for me. The guide was English, the emails sent to Karibu that didn't resolve the situation were useless (among other things, they asked us to send them THEIR confirmation of the Italian guide, absurd).
On the third day in the description there was to be a game before breakfast and one after breakfast. At the end of the second day, having arrived at the tented camp, the guide informs us that there would be no game on the third day because the second day had been long enough so the hours on safari were fulfilled. However, I paid for something else and that I was told at the last minute without a reply, without knowing that I would no longer be in the savannah, was very incorrect. They deprived us of two games that we had paid for!
Only positive note, the guide was very good, kind but I would NEVER recommend this company. Incorrect!"

They will fool you and take your money.,"Me and my friend traveled with Safari Gates and had the worst experience ever. The tour operator and guide did not live up to our expectations and what the itinerary had mentioned whatsoever. Our guide Ben was always late in the morning. We had agreed to meet early morning by the car for our morning game drive 6am. One morning the staff at Enkorok lodge had to WAKE him up because he was still sleeping and we were waiting by the car ready for our game drive. Also, we were promised to go to the Mara river to see the great wildebeest migration/ crossing but he took us to some small tiny lake and pretending ¢®¡Æthis was the Mara river where the animals cross but the crossing stopped in June¢®¡¾, which is all bullshit. This is not my first time to Masai Mara and I have been here before and witnessed the great migration and crossing. Also want to mention we were here during the best time of the year to see this (beginning of September) which is the exact same time of the year I have been here before. Also want to mention that we talked to other people who were there but with other tour agents and they confirmed that they had seen the migration / crossing just the day before. So this was all lies from our guide. He was just being lazy and didn¢®?t wanna take us to the right place / river. Also, on our final day before heading to the airport, we were promised a final morning game drive. We were supposed to meet by the car at 6am. But Ben our guide showed up at 8am!!!!!! 2 hours late on our FINAL day. And if we hadn¢®?t called the tour operator asking where is he , for sure he would never even show up. We have lost so much time and viewing because of this. We always departed late in the mornings because he was late and sleeping. Missing out on the great migration/ crossing because of his lies and didn¢®?t take us there. We have spent so much money on this trip and are so so so disappointed with this trip and operator. We made a complaint before flying back and met with the ¢®¡Æowner¢®¡¾ at the airport before departing and were promised a compensation for this. It¢®?s been more than one month now and haven¢®?t heard ANYTHING about this. Safari gates have really tricked us and fooled us and just taken our money for NOTHING. Even the owner / manager Rihal (also called Rocky) at flamingo hill camp where we spent the last night along with the rest of the staff there witnessed all this and was furious for our sake. Being 2 hours late on our last day and missing our SO much. This is the worst experience I¢®?ve ever had with a safari tour.

A week before the actual trip we got a message from Enrico Safaris and Tours that the tour was cancelled as it did not meet the minimum number. They offered a private tour that was only slightly higher and we booked and paid for entire tour to Enrico Safaris and Tours including accommodation, dinner, breakfast, activities and admissions. We did not realize that we are going to be dealing with a shady and fraudulent tour agency and we are going to have a harrowing time.

On Day 1 we were picked up 2 hours later than scheduled. It was a small car (not suitable for driving on unpaved roads later) and the car¢®?s a/c was not working. After 4 hours of uncomfortable journey the guide/driver managed to get a temporary fix. But we arrived 3 hours behind schedule and had to cut short that days¢®?s game drive in Etosha National Park.

On Day 3 when we reached Swakopmund, the room charges for hotel was not paid for by the Enrico Safaris and Tours. Since they could not be reached, we ended up paying for the rooms for us and for the tour guide.

On days 4 and 5 in Sossusvlei, once again the hotels rooms and dinner were not paid for and also none of the activities were paid for. We had to pay for all these  for us and for the tour guide. 

The guide/driver (who is not an employee of the Enrico Safaris and Tours, but just hired by them for this tour) tried calling Enrico Safaris and Tours several times to address the issue. They either did not answer the call or lied to the guide about sending money, but never sent the money. The guide/driver was a very friendly and a nice person who tried his best to help us out of the harrowing experience. But Enrico Safaris and Tours did not either answer his calls or lied to him repeatedly that he is going to send the money. The guide/driver managed to get a 4x4 on day 4 for travel on unpaved roads on Day 4.

In summary, Enrico Safaris and Tours did not just mishandle the tour but were defrauding and swindling us. In spite of fully paying for the tour in advance to Enrico Safaris and Tours, we still ended up paying for more than half of the accommodation, dinner and activities.

So our recommendation is ¢®¡ÆDon¢®?t trust Enrico Safaris and Tours and Do Not Use their services¢®¡¾."

We have booked a Safari trip in prior, therefore they asked us to send them 480$ as a deposit and so we did. When we have arrived we payed the remaining amount to them. From the very beginning, our trip was disappointing, as we have visited one National park less than it was promised for us. But the worst thing happened in one of the last days of the trip. The guide of the company came to pick us up in the morning and said that there was a problem with our deposit(which we made before the trip) and it was returned to our bank, therefore they are unable to provide us with our last day trip to the national park. So they asked us to pay it again in cash(480$). As we were in Africa we had no possibility to check our bank account, therefore we were forced to pay them extra 480$ as we did not want to lose our last day in Tanzania. Only in the evening, when we got an internet access we check that the money we paid as a deposit prior the trip did not come back to our account, it was paid successfully. We called our guide and is it was the last day of our trip he promised that a representative of the company will come to the airport tomorrow before our flight and will return our second time paid deposit amount. However, he did not arrive and we had no choice but to get on our plane and fly back to our country.

Vincent,CN,Visited: July 2019,24-Aug-19,50-65,first safari,Gassitours Madagascar,1,Terrible experience with Gassitours and its irresponsible owner Belaza,"I¢®?m writing this review to share my family¢®?s disastrous experience with Gassitours and its owner Belaza during our recent trip to Madagascar. In a nutshell: 1) Gassitours¢®? internal coordination errors caused us to miss our flight, which forced us to stay in Morondava for an extra day. Not only did Belaza fail to arrange a guide to help us, he also refused to cover any hotel and transportation expenses for this extra day  2) The contract we signed clearly stated a seven-seat van with air conditioning, but upon arrival we were ushered into a battered seven-seat SUV with a broken air conditioner, and we had to open the windows on the dusty road.  Moreover, the poor SUV broke down one day, leaving us waiting on a deserted stretch of road. In the second leg of our trip, our four-person family was arranged a five-seat SUV, with three crammed in the backseat. On our last day in Madagascar I asked Belaza why he didn¢®?t follow the contract, he said: haven¢®?t you completed your trip anyway?

Our family of four booked an 11-day trip to Madagascar from Gassitours, inclusive of all transportation and accommodations, and we had paid in full. The trip was from July 21st to the 31st, with a flight from Morondava to Tana (short for Antanananrivo) on the 28th. However, when we arrived at Morondava¢®?s airport, the check-in was closed because the flight had changed time to take off earlier. The airline had notified Gassitours of the change, yet our tour guide Tujo never received any notice from the company. Tujo (and Belaza over the phone) attempted to persuade the airport to let us board, as the flight had not taken off yet, but to no avail. We had to wait in Morondava for the next day flight (there is only one flight per day). I asked Tujo what to do next, he said he didn¢®?t know, and then he told me that he and his driver would have to immediately pick up their next clients, who just arrived at the airport.

So I called Belaza asking what he was going to arrange for our delayed day, wherein he replied that it was up to us, as he was unable to send anyone over to help us, nor would he pay any transportation or hotel expenses we would incur. I told him we had already paid Gassitours in full, and the situation we were in was due to their mistakes, so of course he should be responsible. He started making up inexplicable excuses, at which moment I realized that I was probably facing an immoral man. I decided to not argue with him further, taking into account that we still had three days left in Madagascar with his company, costs paid for in advance. We arranged and paid all expenses in Morondava ourselves. 

After losing a day, we landed in Tana and immediately drove to Andasibe, but we were picked up in a five-seat SUV; our family of four could only cram three people in the backseat on the bumpy road for four hours. I asked the driver Alan: weren¢®?t we supposed to be in a seven-seat van? Alan replied, yes, it would have been a bigger car, with a driver and a tour guide, if we arrived yesterday ? but now he was only following Belaza¢®?s arrangements. I was extremely disappointed. For the last seven days, we had been in a muggy seven-seat SUV with a crammed backseat, broken AC, and on the 25th the engine failed in the middle of the road, destroying our plan to see the Avenue of Baobab at the sunset. Now even worse.

After returning to Tana on the night of the 30th, Alan asked me whether I was satisfied with the trip. I said no. Alan then called Belaza and told me that Belaza would meet me in person at 8:30 the next morning (we were to fly out in the afternoon).

The next day, Belaza was an hour late, showing up at 9:30am. The first thing he asked was if I was satisfied with the trip. I replied, of course not. I asked him to explain why he didn¢®?t tell Tujo about our changed flight, causing us to waste a day of our vacation. He said that it was Tujo¢®?s fault, that he should be ¢®?able to tell¢®? that the plane was to take off early. I pointed out that Tujo was an employee of Gassitours, whether it was his fault or not, the company should still be responsible. Belaza then began to say that the airline had a problem. Since it had not yet taken off, why not let us get on the plane? I warned him not to make misleading excuses with me. He said he wasn¢®?t a bad person, otherwise he would disappear and would not come to see me. I was surprised that he had even thought of ""disappearing"".

I asked him what he planned on doing about the extra expenses I had in Monrondava on the 28th. He said he didn¢®?t have that much money, but could ¢®¡Æcompensate¢®¡¾ for half of the amount. I pointed out that because we could not fly to Tana on the 28th, the payment to the hotel in Tana was returned to him. Moreover, in the entire travel expenses we had paid, he reduced his costs by replacing the cars and the hotels specified in the contract: 1) Our van was changed to an SUV without AC in the first 7 days, and then changed to a five-seat SUV in the last 3 days. Belaza explained that the seven-seat van with AC was allocated to another client because it was peak season. 2) One of the hotels we stayed at was switched out for a cheaper alternative. On the night of the 25th, Belaza was unable to secure a hotel as stipulated in the contract, and swapped it for a cheaper hotel, as well as changing our two-room booking to one four-person room. Belaza looked at the contract and continued to talk in circles for half an hour, saying he didn¢®?t have the money. I became irritated and told him stop talking about his lack of money, just answer me one question: why didn¢®?t he honor the contract?

Not only did Gassitours change the car type and the hotel room on the 25th, they also changed our two-room bookings to cheaper four-person rooms on the 23rd and 29th, and were only placed back in two rooms upon our insistence (the hotel on the 25th was full, so we had to stay in a four-person room). The first time this happened on the 23rd, we asked Tujo to contact the company to rectify this mistake and ensure that it would not happen again in the subsequent trip. After the second mistake on the 25th, I sent an email directly to Belaza, verifying that our future bookings were all for two separate rooms, to which he replied confirming it. However, upon arrival to Andasibe on the 29th Belaza had still booked a four-person room.

Belaza¢®?s explanation was such: we were a four-person family, and staying in a four-person room should be no problem; although the car was not the one specified in our contract, it still ¢®?successfully¢®? brought us to the end of our trip. I was furious, and refused his supposed compensation, deciding to go online to inform other people what kind of person Belaza is. In more than an hour of discussion, he fully demonstrated his cunning nature, collecting as much money as possible and not taking any responsibility for even his own mistakes. 

Be careful when you book with Gassitours. We chose them for our trip because we saw good comments about them, probably because there had been no hiccups in those trips. However, once things go wrong, Belaza is completely unreliable. 

Feel free to contact me at yan4866@gmail.com for questions and more details that I haven't written about.

1. Broken down cars (ours broke down and needed to be serviced mid-trip). He will try to say this didn¢®?t happen - well, it did, and we have photos and videos to prove it. We had to wait so long before it was repaired. 
2. Broken radio, You will be the only car in the park that can't communicate with other other guides in the park (which will severely limit your ability to see wildlife). We had agreed that a radio would be in the car - and he guaranteed this, but told us it was broken after we had driven 5 hours and were in the park so there was no turning back. 
3, Tiny windows (like being in a plane), other operators have jeeps with windows twice the size. Im 5'9 and had to hunch to see anything. He will try to say Tanzania requires all cars must be the same model, this is just not true. Look at photos yourself!
4. Philemon tried to put up into a budget lodge after we specifically discussed the lodges we wanted to be in (and had a written contract). We agreed to the lodges and then he tried to make last minute changes to get us in a cheaper one. What a joke! 
5. Philemon tried to cut out a full day of our itinerary (we paid for 5 days, but to save money on park fees etc, he tried to persuade us the safari was only a 4 day trip). We agreed to itinerary e tried to change when we were mid way through!
6. Philemon will require you pay in full upfront. And he is very sweet to work with to start, but once he gets paid in full, he will ignore you and you will receive terrible service from him. 

There are so many other operators, just dont risk your once in a lifetime trip. We chose this company because of the tripadvisor reviews, but it appears that they may not all be true. While out on safari, we did meet several couples/families who had chosen Leopard Tours and seemed to love it. They had modern cars, working radios, and very intelligent and knowledgeable guides. We cant vouch for them since we didnt use them, but I would try anything else but this!

Really disappointed. 

Just don't risk it."
Vishal,US,Visited: February 2016,25-Jul-17,35-50,first safari,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,1,They way they asked for the money spoiled all the positives,"This review may put a new light to how this company wildebeest safari operates and i may be one of the unfortunate ones who have faced this immoral and shallow behaviour from the owner. As a background, i was in touch with Noah, the owner of wildebeest safari for a private 4 night 5 day safari package from nairobi including hotel booking etc. Good communication and the price was agreed and i paid 40% advance. His manager came to meet and greet us at the hotel and it was agreed that the balance payment will be made post completion of the trip. So no hesitation at this stage from Noah or anybody from wildebeest safari. Now on day 2 at flamingo camp in lake nakuru, i had a robbery in my room and usd 3500 worth of stuff gets stolen. Andrew was our guide and driver and was very supportive and a gem of a person. We did the police complaint etc and decided to continue the trip. Come last day and enroute masai to nairobi airport in middle of nowhere, andrew(driver) told me that i have to pay the balance before a certain town or he will drop us there and not take us to Nairobi. I was crossed like hell on this unprofessional approach and then when i talked to noah on this matter, he virtually harassed me to make the payment or the driver will take me to the police station and i will miss my flight etc. In short further misery to my already spoiled holiday. Now all this happened in a span of 2 hours on a lonely strech between masai and the nearest town. I was traveling with my wife and 7 year old son and got scared and out of fear paid the remaining balance. Now paying the money is not a problem but the way i was forced to pay the money was unreal, unprofessional and very shallow. Not sure if this is the was tourists are treated in kenya but that was my experience. "
Vivi,SE,Visited: July 2019,25-Sep-19,20-35,first safari,Wildebeest Safaris LTD,1,Unpleasant experience and cheating happens,"We had an UNPLEASANT experience in Wildebeest Safaris LTD. One of our tour guide, Peter, said he had the card issue for the payment, then he borrowed 300 USD dollars from us to pay the ticket fee for Masai mara National Park, which has been included in our travel fee. He guaranteed that he would return the money to us when we was back to Kenya 3 days later, but we have NOT gotten our money back until we finished our trip. During the trip, we waste a lot of time and stand under the sun to deal with this issue.  After the trip, Wildebeest Safaris LTD said they will deal with the money issue and give us money back. BUT each time we asked for the money issue, they always have an EXCUSE, such as bank issue. 
Wildebeest Safaris LTD does not regulate their staff properly, they even give all the money to the tour guide (including salary and traveling fee) before trips start. So in the worst condition, guides may throw all the clients away before the trips start and take all money away. SO for you guys want to travel in Kenya, you should take the consideration whether you want to take the RISK of using the service from Wildebeest Safaris LTD. And the guide can work for many companies, so they might take your money without any concern of losing job, like Peter in our case.  Besides, communication between Wildebeest Safaris LTD and tour guides is very BAD. Two of our tour guides did not know our schedule at all.

Volodymyr,UA,Visited: September 2018,01-Oct-18,20-35,first safari,Open Africa Safaris,1,Stay away from this travel agency,"I had a terrible experience of a 6-days safari, booked through the Open Africa Safaris.
All that it's representative John Williams said about the tour, was a lie.
In particular, I asked the following questions before paying:

1) Will all six-day safari be the car of your company and run by your employees?
Yes, all six days will be operated by our company's vehicle and employees.
Will there be a safari in mixed with other companies car?
No, all customers will go under our company but from different places ..

But in fact I was attached to a mixed group of tourists from different companies with different programs. The trip took place on the cars of various guides-freelancers. For six days I was transplanted into 4 different cars. None of these machines had the mark of Open Africa Safaris. Two of them did not have a promised chargers, no working fridge and no promised Coffee boxes, Wildlife books and Maps.

2)  Do you provide a sleeping bag and a tent? 
Yes indeed, we provide all camping equipment including, tents, sleeping bags, mattresses and pollows for each client.

But in fact nobody from our group took sleeping bags for two nights in a row. Only the mattresses and the dirty torn sheet with a dirty blanket. The next night was given only to the mattress itself.

3) Does the safari program have a visit to any river?
 Big chences, yes and good news is that our driver will try his best to make sure that you see the wildebeest migration in Serengeti NP. 

But in fact in fact neither migration nor rivers have been seen.

4) Do you already know the number of people in the safari group to which I will join?
You will join 5 more people, so total will be 6 people in the vehicle for the trip.

In fact, two days in the car there were 7 tourists, and I had to sit near the driver without a rooftop.

5) Open Africa Safaris is not ASTA member. Information on this site is false. You can check it on ASTA website.

6) But the worst was not even the above.
Day 1. At the entrance to Tarangire, we lost an hour, since the fee for entering the park was not paid.
Day 2. At the entrance to Serengeti, we lost two hours, as the entrance fee to the park was not paid again. Another hour we lost because of a car breakdown (the battery was down, not some force majeure). Accordingly, there was no game drive this day.
In the evening, we found out that there are no sleeping bags for us. Every other tourist from other companies in camp had sleeping bags.
Day 3. Sunrise game drive until 11:00. After that the guide said that entrance fee for second day in Serengeti not paid and we cannot move on game drive around the park. The half of day was held at Serengeti Airstrip near the payment office, waiting for payment, which was never done on that day. The evening was held in the ranger's office by filing applications and explanations. The half of night was at the police station. 
Lost a day, no gaming drive. There are no sleeping bags again, only tent and mattress. Very cold.
In addition, it turned out that in one car three groups of people with completely different itineraries on the next day.
Day 4. Got a short game drive only at 12:00, after which there was a road to the camp near Ngorongoro. They submerged me into another car as a seventh tourist, in which  I was sitting near driver without access to rooftop.
Day 5. Still in car as 7th tourist without rooftop access. Lost again 40 minutes through unpaid entrance to the Ngorongoro conservation area. They brought to the camp already at 15:00, that is, the half of day of the safari was lost.
Day 6. I began  game drive only at 11:30, because there was no group to which I could join this day. As a result, they sent me a separate car, but they did not even give me water with me. Already at 14:00 I was back in the camp.
Besides, I was never  in the evening, but even during breakfast I did not know which guides and cars I would go to safari that day.

When I wrote to John Williams about a refund for at least a lost  1 full day, he replied that he did not have the money and that I would contact a the subcontractor with whom he shared me and  who actually carried out the safari, which I do not even have contacts with."
VRISHALI,OM,Visited: August 2019,24-Aug-19,50-65,first safari,Lians Travel Africa,1,Fraud Travel Agent in Kenya duping international tourists.,"This review is about LIANS Travel ? actually LIA'R'S Travel,
Run by a woman named Lilian Maina ? actually Lie-Liar.

BEWARE? BEWARE? BEWARE? BEWARE
This company and the woman are a big dirty fraud, playing with international tourist¢®?s money and time and taking them for a ride completely sabotaging their holiday plans.
Unfortunately, me and my wife (Indians) availed their services for a 10 days tour in 2nd week of August-19, but had to return home within 2 days, courtesy Lie-Liar.
Lilian Maina (Lie-Liar) has absolutely no knowleage of her own country's geography, parks, attractions, logistics, flight network, hotel availability,?etc., etc. and is incapable of organizing any tours for the discerning international tourists. They are here only to con international tourists and earn a fast buck. Lie-Liar is an epitome of disrespect, arrogance,?rudeness, selfishness and impoliteness and does not care a hoot about international visitors.
Everything went wrong once we paid the initial 30% advance.
1. The responses from Lilian (Lie-Liar) became slow & required follow up for getting things done
2. There was no sense of urgency in booking the hotels and internal flights although our tour was to start in a week¢®?s time. Finally, Lilian (Lie-Liar) sent fake unconfirmed hotel vouchers.
3. Lilian (Lie-Liar) abruptly moved our first hotel stay to a remote location of her choice at the last moment with total disregard to our itinerary. This resulted in compromising our 1st day's itenerary plan and settle for something that we did not want ? but which Lie-Liar wanted !!
4. Lilian (Lie-Liar) advised somebody would pick us up at Nairobi airport on arrival. However, nobody turned up for an hour and until we called her up. 
5. Lilian (Lie-Liar) demanded for the 70% balance payment on arrival in cash, without providing any confirmed hotel bookings for the entire itinerary. By this time, we had realized that we might not get the services that we are paying for, and deferred this payment for a day, telling Lie-Liar that we shall pay online when we reach the 1st night¢®?s destination.
6. Incidentally, our fears/doubts turned out to be true -
-	Lilian (Lie-Liar) had agreed for a 4x4 Land Cruiser initially, but on reaching Kilaguni Airstrip, gave us the oldest possible rickety van (and of course the cheapest possible) which was so uncomfortable & noisy that it frightened all animals from afar making any sightings impossible.
-	Lilian (Lie-Liar) had advised the name of particular Guide cum Driver initially but instead sent a shady character at the last moment with whom we felt very unsafe and unsecure. His main agenda was to take us to the lodge as soon as possible so that we can make payment to Lilian (Lie-Liar) who was eagerly expecting her 70% payment.
-  Lilian (Lie-Liar) had agreed that all Park Fees are included in the package price, but when we landed at Kilaguni airstrip and entered Tsavo-West National Park, she asked us to pay them instead. 
-	Lie-Liar had mentioned that bottled water is included in the price, but did not provide any.
7. Lilian (Lie-Liar) had thanked us initially for the business and said she will not disappoint us. However, as soon as she got the 30% advance, she gave us only disappointment after disappointment. What a shame for a woman.
8. Once Lie-Liar realized that we are not falling prey to her tactics and accepting whatever she is doling out to us, she became angry and abusive saying that she does not trust Indians. For a tourist service provider, these comments are in poor taste and clearly reflect that she hardly cares for her international clients and is here just want to make a fast buck.
9. Completely exhausted with her tantrums and upset with the proceedings, we were in no mood to go ahead with the tour and therefore decided to abort the trip and returned home within 2 days.

We are sure this must have happened with many international tourists who may not have posted their reviews for various reasons or would have ignored whatever sub-standard stuff was thrown at them. All the good reviews 4/5 and 5/5 that we read about LIANS (LIARS) Travel on various travel sites are fake and just cannot be true. These are definitely posted by Lilian (Lie-Liar) herself. One personal meeting with her is enough to understand what a criminal woman she is, but by then it is too late for the hapless traveler.
To cut the long story short, once the international tourists have paid the 25% - 30% advance, they are caught in the web of LIANS (LIARS) Travels and are compelled to accept whatever is doled out to them. Thus, their tour is completely deranged and they may even have to return empty-handed as we had to in 2 days.
We would therefore strongly urge all international tourists to refrain from taking LIANS (Lilian Lie-Liar) Travel's services for organizing any safaris in Kenya. There are similar bad reviews and experiences from many international tourists about LIANS (LIARS) Travel that are very clear warnings to all.  We therefore urge all travelers not to trust LIANS Lilian (Lie-Liar) in any case and BOYCOTT LIANS (Lilian Lie-Liar) FOREVER."
Waleed H,CA,Visited: August 2023,24-Aug-23,50-65,2-5 safaris,Marangu Treks & Safaris,2,"Looking for a quick BUCK, DO NOT RECOMMEND this company","This outfit came recommended by the Serengeti guide. We were comfortable with the offer, timing and online reviews. However, what was on paper did not translate into proper action plan, neither was there any client care, and attention to important details. We were rushed into picking out our rental apparel.  First night on the mountain we found out that one of the sleeping bags, provided as part of the package, was a junior one. My wife did not fit in it and had a horrible first night. This would have gone horribly wrong if it wasn't for Peter, our guide, for exchangung his sleeping bag with the junior one. We were still at a lower elevation yet. There were some agreements that the owner, Fadhiki, did not fulfill as well. Regardless, when we probed other tourists/climbers, and their packages, they were all comparable. However, we felt that we could have gone with a more reputable company for the same price and for sure a better quality of service. Having said that, our guide and his peeps were incredible. From what we learned, the guide and the team are self employed and were contracted out. Hence, a well established company will have their own trained and experienced staff with much better attention to details and client care. I do not recommend Marangu Treks. A big disappointment. Go with a well established company. "
Waltraud W,AU,Visited: June 2019,01-Jul-19,50-65,2-5 safaris,African Sunrise Travel,1,Awful vehicle,"After checking potential tours and their providers through the African Safari website, my husband and I recently booked a 3 night, 4 day safari tour to Selous and Mikumi with African Sunrise Travel. Their price was USD 980 (incl bank fee) per person +USD40 for the driver-guide, similar to other quotes we received.

Not everything was as described ( e.g., the Mpingo Lodge did not have WiFi), but the vehicle was a modified Landcruiser. However, we needed two vehicles: the first one was ancient (mid-eighties?) and a complete wreck. Rundown, inside and out. No thread on the tyres. Dangerous and not road worthy. It broke down within 15 minutes, and we had to wait for an hour before we were back on the road again with a replacement car.

The second vehicle was also very old but marginally better, at least the tyres were good. However: the air conditioner was not working, and therefore we were exposed to breathe in dust for most of the journey from Dar Es Salaam to Selous and from Selous to Mikumi (I am not referring to the game drives!). Our near new suitcases, other luggage items and ourselves were coated in a thick layer of dust. Nothing worked on the instrument panel. The odometer¢®?s reading was stuck at 467000 km, no idea when that was. The seatbelts were only lap belts and therefore inadequate. There were no hand grips to hold onto. 

In short: the tour was uncomfortable, unhealthy and unsafe."
Wayne,US,Visited: October 2019,31-Dec-19,65+,2-5 safaris,Kanyezi Africa Safari,2,South Africa Safari a $20K DISASTER,"My review is based on the Facts concerning our disaster October 2019 Safari1. Provided flight times 4X to company, arrived in Cape Town after almost two days traveling and NO ONE from this company was there to meet us, would think that a company had been in business for so many years  would have figured out how to meet guests at the airport, we finally found their rep after ONE Hour of searching the airport. We had paid an extra $220 because we were told that the company had to pay a driver to come pick us as we were a separate transfer because of our late arrival. We were very surprised that when we joined our large group that we were packed into a small van with passengers to our knowledge did NOT have to pay an extra transfer fee.  We did NOT have a separate transfer as charged. Next, we choose this very expensive company because they advertise in writing that there will be a 10 guests per expedition.  Another surprise for us was that we had 28 guests on our expedition which was 4 TIMES the advertised limit!! Because there were SO MANY guests, we were packed into small crowded vans for the entire Cape Town portion of this tour with guides who also served as drivers and their explanations could only be heard in the seat next to the driver, a real disaster, very poorly organized. Also we needed assistance in purchasing SA Rand and were UNABLE to get any assistance from Chris or his employees, we eventually solved the problem ourselves, Cape Town tour was totally disorganized as we had NO idea what to see or what to do with the large amount of FREE time we were given on this tour. This review is just the tip of the iceberg as I could almost write a book on how much we were disappointed on paying over $20K for a safari that we experienced so many  problems. We should  have spent this large amount of money on a  different tour operator who was focused on providing more value for the dollar:("
Wess,DE,Visited: January 2020,13-Apr-20,35-50,2-5 safaris,Twinkle Star Tours and Safaris,2,Totally dishonest and unreliable tour operator!,"We booked a 15 day, slightly customized Kenya/Tanzania tour with Twinkle Star through safaribookings.com back in January.
Unfortunately our tour experience was pretty much ruined by the very unprofessional manner in which it was conducted and the dishonesty of James Collins Oketch- the person running Twinkle Star Tours.
Prior to booking the tour I exchanged multiple emails with Mr. Oketch in order to make sure that we will actually be getting the exact same deal that was being advertised on safaribookings.com and the the official website of Twinkle Star Tours.
As we had an elderly person in our group with serious spine problems I asked him specifically if the tour was suitable at all for such a person.
He assured me right away that the tour was more than suitable for all ages and that our companion's health problems will not be an issue during the tour. I also asked him if their tour vehicles are indeed as modern and comfortable as they advertise them to be on their website. He confirmed that their has invested in the most modern and comfortable vehicles possible.
I also asked him to confirm in writing that the advertised accommodations will not be changed at the last moment and that they are indeed up to our desired standards. He confirmed it all. I informed him that my companions and I are all vegetarians and that vegetarian menus should be made available to us during our stay. He said it'll be taken care of.
He kept repeating in his emails 'Our word is our bond my brother. Don't worry about anything.' 
So far so good... only that it all turned out to be a big fat lie.
The moment we transferred him the money for the tour everything went south.
On the very first day after our arrival we were bluntly informed that one of the best and most expensive accommodations in our tour will be changed without our consent to a sub-standard one. Needless to say I protested immediately and reminded James about his promise and our contractual arrangements. Unfortunately, he and his sidekick Benson simply blamed it all on their Tanzanian partners and insisted that nothing could be done about it. 
The car that picked us up for the tour was far from the 'modern, very comfortable safari vehicle' that they claimed to provide their customers with. Instead it was a beat up old minivan that met us in front of our Nairobi hotel.
The thing was in a terrible condition, with no air conditioning and absolutely not road worthy in any normal country around the world let alone be used as a safari vehicle.
The roads, especially in and around Maasai Mara and Amboseli are the closest experience you'll get to actually visiting the moon. It was indeed like a lunar landscape with craters and bumps on every step of the road through which we were speeding most of the time in order to reach our destinations on time.
It doesn't matter how careful our wonderful driver/tour guide Simon tried to drive, avoiding all the massive bumps and holes in that beat up minivan was simply impossible which left us all both emotional unfit to enjoy the safari and often physically bruised.
A funny fact is that most of the other tour companies seemed indeed to have provided proper safari SUV vehicles for their clients just not Twinkle Star.
We were often purposely brought to various tourist trap pit stops where they would try to sell us a tiny wooden keyholder for 25$, served us basic dishes like pizza 'Margherita' for the price one gets in some of the better restaurants in Venice or Paris.
Some of the accommodations we were brought to were very far from the nice, comfortable lodges and luxurious tent camps advertised by Twinkle Star Tours. They often lacked some very basic utilities like hot water and mosquito protection. 
The vegetarian food they offered was scarce and badly prepared to say the very least while there was plenty of choice for meat eaters which made us realize we were basically paying all this money for other hotel guests' rich meals while we were often left to almost starve with just a simple vegetable soup, some bread and rice.
Our 25$ a piece take away meals were often either spoiled, filled with meat products instead of what we ordered or simply absent and believe me when I say, you don't want to find yourself starving in the middle of the savanna while driving through a lunar like surface in a beat up old minivan. The tour will NOT be enjoyable.
Often we had to shower with cold water. One time we were provided with greasy, dirty butter buckets from the hotel's kitchen with some hot water in one of the buckets and the second one to mix it with cold water so the temperature would be bearable.
We missed 1 morning game drive in Masai  Mara, one afternoon game drive in Amboseli, one morning game drive in Amboseli and had to speed up and return only after a couple of hours during our supposed 'full day game drive' in Amboseli only because Twinkle Star had again not provided the otherwise wonderful lodge with our food requirements.
All of this was promptly communicated to James Oketch. Unfortunately, much to our disappointment, he turned out to be a person either unwilling or simply unable to assume responsibility for his and his company's failures. At first he blamed it all on the government for not improving the roads, the quote 'underdeveloped tanzanians', the accommodations themselves,  the weather(which wasn't bad at all btw)and virtually everyone and everything just so the blame and responsibility won't fall on him.
However, after he finally dared blame it all on us, I provided him with many photos of the incidents which are an undeniable proof. I all told him that unless we get at least a humble 100$ pp refund for all of our troubles he can forget about that 5 star review he kept pushing us to give him. So in the beginning of February a refund was finally promised.
To no surprise considering Mr. James Oketch's dishonest and mischievous nature the date for the refund just kept getting pushed forward and forward citing the most ridiculous of reasons or no reason at all while after each and every empty promise we were being swayed into giving him the desired and completely false 5 star review both here and on another popular tour site.
Now finally, after about 2.5 months of waiting and blatant lies he told us to wait this time until May because they had 110 'Covid19' cases in Kenya when we have over 120 000 in Germany.
I asked him, why he hadn't refunded us earlier then, he had more than 70 days to that and back then there was no virus threat and business was still flourishing. No reply.
He just kept making new ridiculous excuses like he would totally refund us right away but all the banks were closed and if they were open he couldn't get out of his house at any time at all and Kenya you need to go directly to the bank and personally order the money transfer regardless of how small the sum is. All of this is obviously a lie. Online banking does exist virtually everywhere nowadays a d he does possess a PesaPal(the African PayPal) account through which he was able to receive our online payment for the tour and he could just as easily send us the small refund at any given time from the comfort of his home.
So bottomline, Twinkle Star Tours and Safaris is totally unreliable. 
James Collins Oketch is an extremely dishonest person who will silver tongue you up until the moment you pay up and then you will be left in faith's hands as no responsibility will be assumed by him or his company for absolutely anything that happens to you or your family and friends during the tour.
He will keep lying through his teeth while calling you his 'brother', citing God and the Bible and telling you what an honest and honorable person he is and how his word is his bond.
Well the Bible says it's a mortal sin to lie Mr. Oketch and you 'sir' lie shamelessly and you lie A LOT. You show up hours late for your meetings without even excusing yourself.
You break your word of honor over and over again and you make empty promises.
The 2 stars this company/tour have received are only because of our wonderful driver/tour guide- Timothy Simon, the magnificent animals inhabiting Kenya and Tanzania and the breathtaking beauty of the nature there.
Anyone who wants a physical proof in the form of email/WhatsApp screenshots or photo evidence is more than welcome to contact me at any given time!"

Astonished we said that according to the mail the safari lasts 5 nights and 6 days. Suddenly nobody wanted to know anything about that. After a phone call and SMS to George, he then admitted that there is probably a misunderstanding, he actually meant only 4 nights even if there are 5 nights! Astonished and annoyed, we tried to make it clear to him that we expect 5 nights at this price according to the mail. George does not want to know anything about it and there was also no compensation. The end of the safari was accordingly bad, as we desperately tried to get another accommodation at a reasonable price! Thus, we have now paid an extra night and also the full price - which was for 5 nights. From our point of view, this is pure rip-off. Who books here, must clarify beforehand how many days and nights are included in the booking to avoid nasty surprises. We do not recommend this tour operator

Wilai Deelert,TH,Visited: May 2019,07-Jun-19,35-50,first safari,Reny Safaris,1,Bad travel agent in Africa,"Me and my husband booked 6 days 5 nights safari tour in Kenya with this company. Ms.Regina and Jecton the driver were cheating people.
They changed our itinerary on spot. They tried to avoid to pay for the National Park to save the budget which makes us miss the morning and evening safari.
One day on our itinerary, we have to do evening safari in Amboseli National Park but the driver try to delay the drive to arrive late in hotel because he doesn't want us to visit the park and he can save at least 140 us dollars. 
We paid money for safari but we miss two times Safari because of this bad people, Regina and Jecton
Don't use this company if you don't want to disappoint with your Safari experience..

Will,AT,Visited: August 2022,07-Sep-22,20-35,2-5 safaris,La Mara Tourism,1,TERRIBLE,"NOT RECOMMENDED. Avoid booking tours with this company. We reserved a private safari with this company and agreed on an itinerary including two game drives (3 hours in the afternoon and 2 hours in the morning next day) for every national park in our tour. The day of our tour, the driver (not even the tour office) informed us that the game drives in the morning were not possible because the parks changed their re-entry policies. The change in policies is totally understandable, but the lack of transparency is not. We did not have the option to decide whether a tour with only 3 hours of game drive a day nor had we replacement activities in the mornings. The tour was very expensive and we spent most of the day driving to the parks. Furthermore, the driver was very rude, poor in English communication and very irresponsible on the road. The first day when we had only 3 hours in the Ol Pejeta Conservancy park, the driver took us to the park very late (3 PM) even if we were ready to leave at 1:30 PM. It rained that day so we were not able to see the chimpanzees, which was the main reason to visit that park. When we arrived to see the rhinos he did not even explain us where to go or what to do, so we also missed that. In general, very bad organization from this company."
William,US,Visited: July 2019,07-Sep-19,50-65,first safari,Swala Safaris Ltd.,2,Terrible Vehicle - Great guide,"We were extremely disappointed with our experience with Swala due to the dilapidated condition of the vehicle we were put in. The car was clearly greater than 20 yrs old, super high mileage and in terrible condition. It was very underpowered and clearly badly misaligned. To go straight, the steering wheel was at 4 o'clock. We were always the slowest on the road; our guide did not seem comfortable driving the vehicle at regular speed. 3 of 6 seat belts were nonfunctional, passenger doors couldn't be opened from inside and none of the seats had headrests. The ""cooler"" did not cool so drinks were always warm. We had several harrowing moments. Leaving the Serengeti, the car made a sparking noise and smoke came out the dash vents. Fortunately, after waiting a bit, it restarted and smoke stopped. Another time, while climbing out of Ngorongoro crater, transmission popped out of gear and the car made a bad smell and initially, would not go back in gear. We held our breaths the rest of the trip out of the crater. Also, the brakes started squeaking horribly and we needed to take the time to take it to a local mechanic because we had no faith that the car could be safely driven. Thank god for our outstanding guide, Sunday, who not only was extremely talented at picking out wildlife and providing a fountain of knowledge regarding animals and habitats but also possessed much needed mechanical skills. Throughout our 7 day safari, I did not see a single other vehicle in nearly as poor condition. Honestly, we felt very unsafe and several times seriously considered abandoning the rest of our trip out of safety concerns..

So if you are looking for a safari with an extra dose of discomfort and fear, Swala is for you. Otherwise, I'd stay away. Sunday our guide, however, was outstanding and I would go again with him (with a different company) anytime.

FYIOur car did not resemble any of those in their pictures.  My guess is they are too embarrassed to show it.."
WorldTravell3r,AT,Visited: August 2013,04-May-16,35-50,first safari,SafariBook Evolution,2,Terrible choice to sub-contract the Tanzania portion of our Trip,"We recently went on a Safari (Kenya and Tanzania) with SafariBookEvolution. These guys can handle Kenyan safari alright, but they were not forthcoming about the fact that they don't run the Tanzanian safari themselves, and it was nothing short of a disaster as they sub-contract to Jackpot safaris (who basically give you dangerous cars, careless guides and put your lives in danger. See below the list of issues we faced. I wouldn't recommend them and can't say much for Safaribook Evolution as they but us in a very terrible situation.
 
Kenyan Safari issues
 
1) no power at destiny Eco camp for 2 days
2) no hot water at destiny Eco camp for 2 days, although we were promised.

Tanzanian Safari issues
 
Safety - We put our families in danger. Don't risk it!
 
1) Car's door kept opening right in the middle of game drives and on the highways endangering our families.
 
2) The car's open top literally fell on us which could have killed all of us. Thankfully we were sitting at that time.
 
3) Car broke down in the middle of forest. And the driver had least concern for our safety. A speeding vehicle nearly crashed on our car. 

4) We were lost in the jungle of for four hours with the driver George not having a clue about where we were. He didn't even have the mobile number of the Kati Kati camp. 

Value for Money - Zero
 
5) We paid a lot for the Kati Kati camp's luxury tent, but stayed there just for 8 hours in Kati Kati camp without enjoying any part of the stay. Thanks to George who got us lost in the jungle.
 
6) Car was small and cramped in Tz for 3 days. When we complained about this, George said he couldn't drive the other car so we ended up using the same cramped car for one more day which eventually broke down.
 
7) The guide/driver was very rude and arrogant, not well informed(like he didn't have the phone number of the Kati Kati camp when we were lost in the jungle.
 
8) The tents given to us at the flamingo hotel were so small. We had to pay $200 extra to get the rooms. Andrew (Jackpot Safari) threatened to cancel the whole safari even though he saw we had 2 small kids.
 
9) No binoculars for the Tz safari, although we were promised that we will be given one.
 
10) The itinerary was changed mid way, only one day at the Tarangire national park as opposed to two days.
 
11) the Tz driver has a total lack of interest with the safari, with us having to push him to go on game drives. For example we spent only 2 hours at the Lake Manyara game drive. Then we had to call the managers to get him to take us to another game drive. 

12) The Tz driver only drove us around the main gate most of the time. We had to constantly push him to drive a little bit further. As soon as he shows us one thing, he will be satisfied, but we were not as we have paid a lot of money. 

13) The last two days were completely useless, especially Tarangire was a complete waste of time. We didn't see anything partly because of the itinerary change. George, the Tz driver, lied to us that Tarangire will take 3 hours to reach when it took only an hour and a half.
 
14) The Tz driver tried to sneak into all the parks without paying for the kids

The list goes on.  But there are two big things to keep in mind.  First, Safaribook Evolution never informed us that they subcontract the trip in Tanzania, nor did they tell us who it would be doing our trip.  In the end they are responsible for our trip and our safetey.  Second, was anytime we spoke to Andrew about the problems he was not willing to discuss ways to solve them, but would simply threaten to stop the safari and abandon us in Arusha.  This is very unprofessional, especially as we were only asking for what was written in the itineary and to be in a safe vehicle.

Don't use them of Tanzania!!!"
Xavier,IN,Visited: October 2022,08-Nov-22,65+,2-5 safaris,Mama Savana Safaris,1,Dissapointing and Short changed all along the way . Imagine - we were not shown the Mt Kilimanjaro !,"
I look at all the 5 * reviews of all the satisfied passengers here on this post and wonder what went wrong with my trip . 

Im a tour operator from India , and I was travelling with 13 passengers on a 15 day trip of Tanzania and Kenya. I normally use individual partners at all my destinations and make payments after the service is done but got connected to Alex through my Kenya partner who assured me they would take care of the entire trip together professionally and seamlessly .

What happened :

- I promised to show my group the Ngorongoro crater and Mt Kilimanjaro , and we booked our flights to fly out from Kilimanjaro airport . Ngorongoro was ok , but the drivers wasted time the next day and did not give us a proper timing . They then drove us to Moshi - 20 miles from Kilimanjaro and then insisted that we turn back because we might miss the flight ! My passengers were sooooooooooooooooo dissapointed . And so was I .

- We flew to Zanzibar . We were promised a walking tour of StoneTown + a city tour drive of Zanzibar to familiarise ourselves with our surroundings . - There was no city drive . The vehicle didnot turn up . The history guide was very average . Nothing special . He was only keen on getting us to book the prison Island tour with him .

- We flew to Daresalam . We were met by our guide at the airport . Lovely man but almost ignorant . Infact , he admitted that he had only passed out of basic schooling !! 

- Mombassa was a good experience . Good , friendly and helpful Guide who took good care of my group - and he probably saved me from the disappointment of my clients .

- Last Stop Nairobi - I was looking to meet up with my partner in Nairobi - the guy who had reccommended that I work with Alex and him , only to be given the sob story that Alex had double crossed him and worked with another partner in Nairobi . His new partner Mr John was also extremely rude and made it like he was doing everybody a favour . 
On the last leg to the airport , John tried to pack us off to the airport in dusty safari vans which had just returned from the MAsai . After much talking , he agreed to send us a minivan .

Very dissapointing and short changed all along the way .

I had to take a lot of flack from my clients when we returned home ."
yael borovsky,IL,Visited: October 2017,20-Jan-18,20-35,first safari,Absolute Africa,1,Nice but expensive to what we get,"We paid a lot of money to this trip (around 4000$ for 2 people) and we got simple meals (especially breakfast) and sleeping in tents compared to other organized tours that you can sleep in lodges with better meals for almost the same cost. 
we also had an issue with one operator in Serengeti that took us on a safari. the communication there was bad and even rude with the guides/drivers. they also asked to pay high tip at the end which was our choice whether we wanted to pay or no

In overall we enjoyed the trip with the company but we believe it can be much cheaper for getting such outdoor conditions "
Yamen,PH,Visited: December 2016,08-Sep-17,20-35,first safari,Tekko Tours and Travel,1,we don't recommend this company,"we just done Safari with this company, and it was very bad experience:
we booked a Land cruiser, it was very very slow, and it has almost no power, when overtaking its very dangerous, and the driver need very long clearance distance to overtake (sometimes it takes 20 min waiting behind a big truck who is driving 30km/h).
Driver was not exceeding 50-55 Km/h on  the highway, for 6-7 long driving hours everyday ( this is according to my accurate Garmin GPS)

 the worst part of the trip is the driver himself, we don't feel comfortable at all with him,  he speaks English well, but he doesn't want to talk or explain anything about the country or the trip,and the way he answers any question it will make you think 100 times before asking him again.
he complains every time we ask him to stop for toilet, and he claimed that there is no toilets all over the way, until we forced him to stop. 
he never ever give any straight answer when asking for the distance or timing to arrive to the camp, 
we drive daily 6-7 hours from park to park, whenever we ask him where are we, or how long we still need to arrive?he answer ( we are not far).  this is so annoying, so we start asking the locals when we stop in the petrol stations,  and he also complains, and he said ( stop asking them they will not know).
we been in many many countries with privet drivers, but nothing was like this.
the driver is very important in such a trip, because you are all the day with him inside the car, and its serious problem if they make you feel uncomfortable.

Yarik,ZA,Visited: July 2017,10-Aug-17,50-65,2-5 safaris,Jocky Tours and Safaris,1,Terrible standard for much too high price,"My review is based on comparison - we experienced services of 2 agencies in Kenya, for 2 different Safaris.
We (the couple from Poland) went to Maasai Mara national park, in tour organised by Jocky Tours (Bison safari in internet). We had already experience with safari, since we went few days before to Tsavo East and Amboseli, so we have had some expectations, which have not been met in ANY aspect.
Lodging and food - terrible, much closer to the army camp than tourist lodging. We have been accomodated in Rhino Camp (claiming to be the best camp in Maasai Mara, really!!!), but it is very far from what you expect. I have to mention that at booking time we were offered Lenchada Camp, what has been changed without any prior information to us. Just dropped in other camp, no explanation.
Food on the road and in the camp - dirty(!) dishes, no choice of food, dirty placedisgusting in every aspect. In the camp - do not take a look into the kitchen (what is difficult, kitchen is open all the time)), otherwise you will stay hungry...
The driver/guide - not interactive with passengers at all. All the time on CB, listening and responding to other CB users, not providing any information to people on board and not reacting on your requests to stop, see something, etc. Last day he was 45 min late to pick us up from the camp, without even a word of apology! 
To sum up - price (310 $/pp) does not meet the offered standard. For mentioned above another tour (which was private one - only 2 of us on board), we paid 275 $/pp, receiving great accomodation (hotel Voi Wildlife Lodge and high standard campSenirim Amboseli), great food (on the road and in the hotel) of good choice and service, fantastic guide - informing about what we see, responding to our needs, good tracer of game, always on our request.
I did try to claim to agency received service, but they don't care at all...

Yaxin,UK,Visited: August 2017,21-Aug-17,under20,2-5 safaris,Wild Race Africa,1,Terrible experience!,"1. I said we are a group of six. I found out that this company booked us 2 triple rooms intead of 3 double rooms. Simon, the boss of this company, first said that he had told me in email, which was not true. Then he said this is reasonable because I hadn't made it clear that I need 3 double rooms. Finally he said he need 136$ per person, which is 816 $ in total, to change it to double rooms for the rest 2 nights.

2. The first guide is not fluent in English and poor in experience. He took us to Masai Mara at 4.30 p.m. (it should be 3 p.m.) He first decided to take us to the lodge, then changed the direction and took us directly to the NR, so we again wasted a lot of time. He borrowed Shilings from us to buy tickets because he only had US dollar. He took us back to the hotel at 8.10 p.m. when we were super hungry."
Yazid,FR,Visited: July 2023,01-Aug-23,35-50,over 5 safaris,Viva Safaris,2,Disappointed,"we booked for 5 days. We have safari experience. unfortunately we were disappointed. The group is too big, the cars are not comfortable, some drivers seem inexperienced and so you don't see much. And the meals are catastrophic and not generous. In short, everything was counted. and shortened safari times. After Botswana, Kenya and Tanzania, we are disappointed. especially since the Balule reserve is really not terrible with electric cables crossing the area and which takes away the charm of the real safari."
Yoshi,JP,Visited: October 2019,10-Nov-19,35-50,first safari,Suricata Safaris,1,Please confirm your itinerary carefully,"We booked a 3 day tour exchanging mails with Suricata Safaris. We selected their tour from many options because they offered a tour with a luxury tented camp by a reasonable price in Safari booking.com. We carefully confirmed their offer many times before the booking, since a safari tour was our main purpose to go to Tanzania.
However, we realized they had prepared just a budget tent for us on arriving at a camp site in the evening on the first day.  Here, what I want to say is that there might be difference between their offer shown in Safari booking.com and their actual tour. I recommend you to ask them to make precise itinerary for your tour in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I hope no one have such a disappointing experience anymore. 
Finally, though I think it was quite expensive as a safari tour with the budget tent compared with other offers, the only salvation was quality of a driver and a cook."
Yuan,FR,Visited: July 2019,23-Jul-19,20-35,first safari,Back of Africa Adventure ltd,1,I had to tell myself not to be mad and enjoy this honey moon private tour,"I'm here to note the tour operator so I'd like to state several facts dealing with Back of Africa:
1. Allan asked me to pay the balance in cash but we don't have any USD, so he added 40 dollars (I can't remember how much excatly) bank fee in order to pay by card.

2. Three hours after departure we realized that it's not the direction to our first destination Amboseli so asked our driver. He told us we're actually going to Masai Mara. 

3. I contacted Allan, he replied sorry for not telling us, and the program change is due to non availability at a lodge. Given that we were asked to pay the deposit 3 months ago ""in order to secure the logistics"", it's simply NOT acceptable to make the reservations at the last minute then realize that it's full. After carefully studying and made this tailored grogram together, imagine my furstration when Allan reversed our itinerary without informing us at all. 

4. Since the itininary is reversed, I asked for a new full program. He said ok but I never recieved anything until the end of the trip.

5. On the initial program is included 3 hot meals per day, except for the full day safari in Masai Mara. Surprisingly we were given 3 times this non editable and completly non hygiene lunch box (imagine a toast sandwich with cheese and a greasy chicken leg after 5 hours under the sun). So we didn't have lunch and starved the whole day until I suffered from stomachache every evening. For the 3rd time I had to complain and fight for a real meal during our 7 hours drive from Naivasha to Ambosali. 
(Allan told us later that full board hotel booking is only 5 dollars more expensive than half board, so it's more interesting for him to book with in-hotel lunch or lunch box. Again, since our program is changed, the road trips don't allow a in-hotel lunch. Since he never sent over the new program, we always needed to figure out by ourselves where we go the next day, and have no clue of lunch arrangement.)

6. On the last day back to Nairobi, Allan joined us for lunch, and asked us to express ourselves. He said sorry again, gave us loads of excuses that we as customers find it hard to accept. I asked on D1 some form of compensation which he refused, because he is too busy, and ""miastake is human"", and he ""learned the lesson"". This meeting is a pointless loss of time for our holiday.

7. I felt offended during this whole meeting. Allan was adressing only to my boyfriend and never looked at me, even when saying goodbye.

I would definately recommend Kenya and loved the breath taking scenaries and amazing animals.
Our driver and guide George is quiet and doesn't really smile, but has adequate knowlege and did his job.

These moments of frustration were not expected especially given the price we paid, we need to at least have the service we booked. 
If I have any advice to give, do check every detail with him before you pay, and do not trust."
YUKO,DE,Visited: January 2016,14-Jan-17,35-50,first safari,Arkman Safaris,2,Payment was very unconvinient,"Guide and operator who take us to the safari actually was very friendly and excellent.
But conductor who manage our trip from Arkman Africa was problematic person.
I wished to pay VISA card, but he did not understand what I wanted to do and we waste time a half day. In addition, the day of the trip, he did not come despite he said he also will come to make sure the attendants. And he did not communicate the guide who will attend actually in the trip. We loss one our or more to make sure who will attend."

The guides were good and the accommodations were good, however this much driving completely ruined our experience and I would never do it again. There was two days we were supposed to do 2 game drives but we didn't do any since it took all day to get to destination."
